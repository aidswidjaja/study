# Good job with your exams everybody!
## If you're still doing them, good luck for you too! Adrian's Study Club will be maintained again next year (to move all of the old content on and fix [Known issues](issues.html))

***

# “Haven’t we all done this in our Maths Summary Books?”

## This website contains archives of Adrian's digitised exam resources and stuff like that. Feel free to use it for your own intents and purposes.

***

Stuff like this used to get hosted on Google Drive but 99 page Google Docs can get laggy very quickly. As I'm usually the only person working on my own resources, I didn't need the system that could support editing as well, so I'm now hosting it on this nice website. It's a bit cleaner, faster, and more pleasant than Googly Drive and I can manage it myself which is good.

I've got more of where this stuff came from over on [Quizlet](https://quizlet.com/class/10813900/) so take a look there if there's things missing from here. If you're here for past papers (most likely because you don't go to my current school and I'm a nice friend) check out the Extra Resources section for Maths 5.3, Science and Commerce.

### What do you have here?

I've got a few things on this website including:
- Study notes
- Cheat sheets
- Practice papers

and other things that might be of interest to you.

### Who is using this website?

This is mostly for my closer friends and friends outside of my current school, as well as a digital record for myself, but if you're not my friend that is okay and you can use it too. Just try not to tell too many people about it though.

### How much have you already completed?

You can see our [Roadmap](roadmap.html) which contains our schedule and projected topics. In the future, a "Last modified" footer will be available as well. See this [GitHub issue](https://github.com/pmarsceill/just-the-docs/issues/166) and [pull request](https://github.com/pmarsceill/just-the-docs/pull/217) for more information.

### The content I want isn't available or hasn't been completed yet!

You should check out [Khan Academy](https://khanacademy.org) and [BBC Bitesize](bbc.co.uk/bitesize). If you're using Bitesize both KS3 and GCSE content can apply to you (more likely GCSE) and we suggest using the CCEA exam board.

### How can I download this offline?

Please see [Offline Copies](offline.html) for more information. A lot of the extra resources are available as a Google Doc too, so email me if you want access to that or check the Extra Resources page on each corresponding subject.

### Is there more?

If you'd like to contribute, please feel free to [email me](mailto:adrian.marcus.widjaja@gmail.com?I want to contribute to Adrian's Study Club!) and let me know what you can help out with.

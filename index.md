# Welcome to Adrian's Study Club
### Study notes and resources from Adrian

I'm doing my best to archive study notes and resources from Year 9 till the NSW HSC death game... a lot of these resources are incomplete (or just not very good), but I'll try my best to keep Preliminary and HSC course notes updated as best as I can! I might also upload old assessment tasks once they're past the due date.

If you prefer, there's Google Docs links here (and these get edited live!), but are only accessible to people in my school :) if you're from outside my school but know me irl, send an email to sekolah@adrian.id.au and I'll get you access.

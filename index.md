# “Haven’t we all done this in our Maths Summary Books?”

## This website contains archives of Adrian's digitised exam resources and stuff like that. Feel free to use it for your own intents and purposes.

***

Historically stuff like this got hosted on Google Drive but 99 page Google Docs can get laggy very quickly. As I'm usually the only person working on my own resources, I didn't need the system that could support editing as well, so we're now hosting it on this nice website. It's a bit cleaner, faster, and more pleasant than Googly Drive and I can manage it myself which is good.

I've got more of where this stuff came from over on [Quizlet](https://quizlet.com/class/10813900/) so take a look there if there's things missing from here, and if you're doing the Maths 5.2 curriculum and you'd like to see what the 5.3 bois are up to, check out this [Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Lc8Ct2LC0LQ_yq95yTJHZh5Sq8j7gDBN?usp=sharing). That Google Drive link also contains the link to the spiritual precursor of this project, Maths and Science Study Notes.

### What do you have here?

We've got a few things on this website including:
- Study notes
- Cheat sheets
- Practice papers
- Student-made Quizzes

and other things that might be of interest to you.

### Who is using this website?

I'm only sending it to my friends for the time being, but if you're not my friend that is okay and you can use it too. Just try not to tell too many people about it though.

### Help! The search function doesn't work!

I'm currently waiting on a bugfix from the developers of Just the Docs, the Jekyll theme I'm using to host this website. Currently the `rake` command in bundle fails due to some unescaped ampersands in the code lol. Once the fix is released search will be available on this site. In the meantime, you can use `Ctrl` + `F` or `Cmd` + `F` to search for text on a page.

### How much have you already completed?

You can see our [Roadmap](roadmap.html) which contains our schedule and projected topics.

### How can I download this offline?

Please see [Offline Copies](offline.html) for more information.

### Is there more?

If you'd like to contribute, please feel free to [email me](mailto:adrian.marcus.widjaja@gmail.com?I want to contribute to Adrian's Study Club!) and let me know what you can help out with.

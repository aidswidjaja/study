# “Haven’t we all done this in our Maths Summary Books?”
## Welcome to Adrian's Study Club - a database of study notes, past papers and exam resources I've collected over the years.

***

### What do you have here?

I've got a few things on this website, including [study notes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Note-taking), [cheat sheets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheat_sheet), [past papers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Past_paper) and exam resources. If you're here for past papers (most likely because you don't go to my current school and I'm a nice friend) check out the Extra Resources section for Maths 5.3, Science and Commerce.

### How much have you done?

See the [Roadmap](roadmap.html) for each corresponding subject to see what's been finished, what's to be done and what will not be completed.

### The content I want isn't available or hasn't been completed yet!

Sorry I'm not smart enough to get into the accelerated maths course. See Extra Resources on each page if there are any useful external links that I like. Otherwise, you should check out [Khan Academy](https://khanacademy.org) and [BBC Bitesize](bbc.co.uk/bitesize). If you're using Bitesize both KS3 and GCSE content can apply to you (more likely GCSE) and I suggest using the CCEA exam board. You can also help out by seeing how you can contribute in [How can I help?](#how-can-i-help). I also have more resources available on [Quizlet](https://quizlet.com/class/10813900/).

### Who uses this website?

Not many people. It's mostly for me but is also used by my friends from my current and other schools. You can use this website too, but please do not tell too many people about it - because otherwise I'll be pressured into producing higher-quality content 😪

### How can I download this offline?

`Print >> Save to PDF`, or if you're more technically inclined see [Offline Copies](offline.html). There's a lot of content available for download as a PDF immediately or on a Google Doc, so check the Extra Resources page on each corresponding subject.

### How do I know if Adrian's Study Club goes down?

If there is an intentional shutdown of Adrian's Study Club, you'll get a maintainence message. Otherwise, you can go to [this website](https://aidswidjaja.github.io/social/#is-it-currently-online) to check whether the site is live or if there is an error. If there is an error, I'm probably working on a fix, but if it hasn't been patched in a couple of days [let me know.](mailto:adrian.marcus.widjaja@gmail.com?There's an error with the deploy of your site.) 

### How can I help?

[Letting me know](mailto:adrian.marcus.widjaja@gmail.com?I want to contribute to Adrian's Study Club!) would be a great start! If you've already got notes written on a Google Doc or Microsoft Word document these can easily be ported to the website.

With credit to the following resources:

* Core Science Stage 4 NSW Australian Curriculum Edition 
* Core Science Stage 5 NSW Australian Curriculum Second Edition
* BBC Bitesize GCSE (CCSE, AQA, OCR, and Edexcel)

#### STUDY NOTES

*Be advised some chapters are being omitted as they are not planned and won't be worked on, and therefore redundant. They won't carry the Redundant label but will just be left out of it entirely. This applies to chapters Stage 5 and onwards.*

## Stage 4 Concepts and Outcomes

##### Release note: All of these are yet to be uploaded to this website...

#### Chemical reactions <label class="label label-yellow">Redundant</label>
- [ ] Naming simple compounds and writing word equations. 
- [ ] Identifying physical and chemical changes. 
- [ ] List of changes that indicate a chemical reaction has occurred. 
- [ ] Observations of chemical reactions, describe changes occurring, and factors affecting the reaction the effect of temperature on a reaction and Changing the reaction rate). 

#### Energy <label class="label label-green">Complete</label>
- [x] What is energy, and how can we detect it?
- [x] Definition of energy as ability to make things move and cause changes.
- [x] Types of energy, make a list with examples.
- [x] Discuss the difference between energy transfer and energy transformation.
- [x] Define the Law of Conservation of Energy.
- [x] Discuss heat and temperature.
- [x] Heat energy and three ways of heat transfer, with examples.
- [x] Observing convection currents – either potassium permanganate or tea leaves as water is heated.
- [x] Radiation – Infrared is heat radiation, relate to the Sun.
- [x] Explain the three things that can happen when radiation hits an object – it can be transmitted, reflected or absorbed.
- [x] Solar ovens: identify materials in the oven where heat is transmitted, reflected or absorbed and reducing heat loss.
- [x] Heat insulation and how it prevents the 3 types of heat transfer.
- [x] Insulation of homes.

#### Regular circuits <label class="label label-yellow">Redundant</label>
- [ ] The symbols for simple electrical components, p 351, & how to use them to draw simple circuit diagrams. 
- [ ] Differences between series and parallel circuits (building regular circuits). 
- [ ] Examine different ways of connecting two globes to a power source and record circuit diagrams and the effects different arrangements have on brightness and when one bulb is removed. 
- [ ] Explanation of Conductors and Insulators. 

#### Cells <label class="label label-yellow">Redundant</label>
- [x] Cell theory and the requirements of cells.
- [x] Discuss the different kinds of organisms. Identify the difference between multicellular and single celled organisms. 
- [ ] Identify some of the basic components of a cell. 
- [ ] Discuss the hierarchy of cell, tissue, organ and system in multicellular organisms. 
- [ ] Explain the need for cells to exchange substances with the environment. 
- [ ] Discuss what substances move into cells and what substances move out of cells. Use word equations for photosynthesis and respiration. 

#### Nutrients, food and diet <label class="label label-yellow">Redundant</label>
- [ ] Discuss the reasons living things require food in terms of energy, growth and repair. 
- [ ] Describe the aerobic respiration of glucose in the cells of all organisms, including chemical word equation. 
- [ ] Define nutrients. 
- [ ] Discuss the 5 main groups of nutrients, including what they are used for, different forms of these and what they are broken down into during digestion and absorption (why we need nutrients). 
- [ ] Discuss the need for water and fibre in the diet. 

#### The digestive system <label class="label label-green">Complete</label>

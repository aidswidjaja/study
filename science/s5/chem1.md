## Model of an atom

Model of an atom:

1. Small and dense nucleus made up of:
    2. neutrons (uncharged particles)
    2. protons (positively charged particles)
1. Surrounded by rapidly moving electrons
1. Held together through nuclear forces

*Particles with the same charge **repel each other**.*
*Particles with opposite charges **are attracted to each other**.*

Most volume of the electron is made up of empty space.

* Electrons == 1/2000th size of protons and neutrons.
* Electrons have electrical charge of -1
* Protons have electrical charge of +1
* Neutrons have no electrical charge
* Atoms usually have the same number of electrons as neutrons
* Electrons move rapidly around the nucleus, in regions known as [electron shells](#electron-shells)

* In the nucleus: protons and neutrons
* Surrounding the nucleus: electrons

**The number of protons in an atom determines what type of atom it is**

e.g gold atom has 79 protons

## Electrons
### and the 2, 8, 18 rule
{: .no_toc }

Electrons fill electron shells. The number of electrons a shell can fit increases as the shell's distance from the nucleus increases. The outermost shell is called the valence shell.

The numnber of electrons a shell can hold is equal to `2n^2` where n is the shell number.

Therefore:
```
2 × 1^2 = 2 (for shell one)
2 × 2^2 = 8 (for shell two)
2 × 3^2 = 18 (for shell three)
```
and so on. This is called the **2, 8, 18 rule**. Electrons fill from the inner most shell going outwards. You can see a diagramatic representation on this electron dot diagram.

#### Examples of electron configurations

Aluminium has 13 protons, therefore aluminium's **electron configuration** is `2, 8, 3`

Sodium has 11 protons, therefore sodium's **electron configuration** is `2, 8, 1`

Oxygen has 8 protons, therefore sodium's **electron configuration** is `2, 6`

#### Excited atoms

When an atom is excited it may "jump" to a higher electron shell. They drop back down and release **light energy**.

#### Groups in the Periodic Table

There are 18 groups in the periodic table. Here are some important ones

## Atomic numbers and mass numbers

#### Atomic number

We know that the number of protons an atom has dictates what atom it is. In the periodic table, this is known as the atomic number.

```
Number of protons == Number of electrons == Atomic number
e.g Chlorine has 17 protons therefore it's atomic number is 17
```

Atoms are electrically neutral and must have **the same number of electrons as protons**. Otherwise, they become ions.

#### Mass number

```
Mass number == number of protons + number of neutrons
```

Electrons are too small to be counted.

#### Subatomic particles

You can represent the mass number and atomic number of an element like this:

![AZE1](/resources/science/AZE2.jpg)

where:
- `A` is the atomic number
- `Z` is the mass number, and
- `E` is the element symbol.

For example, for the element iron,

![FE AZE](/resources/science/AZE1.jpg)

You can use this information to calculate the number of neutrons...
    number of neutrons = A − Z = 56 − 26 = 30


... and the number of electrons or the number of protons.
    number of electrons = number of protons = Z = 26

## Ions

Ions are atoms that have gained or lost electrons. It means they have an electric charge. Positive ions have more protons than electrons, and vice versa. When the outer shell is filled atoms tend to be more stable (which is why it's cool to be noble – elements with full valence electrons).

For example, a sodium atom might need to lose an electron to have a full valence shell, and a chloride atom might need to gain an electron to have a full valence shell. The sodium atom can lose an electron to the chloride atom and now both atoms have full valence shells.

### Naming Ions

Positive ions are called **cations**, while negative ions are called **anions**. Cations keep their original name (e.g boron, lithium, etc) while negative ions have the -ide suffix (e.g flouride, nitride, etc).

#### Common ions

| Atom name     | Ion name  | Chemical symbol | Atom name     | Ion name | Chemical symbol |
|---------------|-----------|-----------------|---------------|----------|-----------------|
| lithium       | lithium   | Li+             | iodine        | iodide   | I−              |
| sodium        | sodium    | Na+             | fluorine      | fluoride | F−              |
| potassium     | potassium | K+              | chlorine      | chloride | Cl−             |
| calcium       | calcium   | Ca2+            | oxygen        | oxide    | O2−             |
| aluminium     | aluminium | Al3+            | nitrogen      | nitride  | N3−             |

# Things You Should Know is a free service to help you stay on top of your assessments, events and co-curricular activities.

## • when Assessment Notifications come out
## • when Assessments are due
## • when you need to study for Exams
## • when Excursions and Events occur

Things You Should Know can help you stay on top of your assessments, events and co-curricular activities. Our volunteer-driven and independent service pushes notifications through WhatsApp and Email to remind you when Assessment Notifications come out, when Assessments are due, when you need to study for exams, and other things you should know about. Please be advised Things You Should Know is a student-run service that is not affiliated with the school, and you are encouraged to also keep track of your own schedules and events, as we are also humans and can forget things too. Join the service at [tinyurl.com/AloysTYSK](https://tinyurl.com/AloysTYSK). This is a voluntary service; no warranties provided. You can leave the group at any time. Elective subject info may not be covered due to lack of information.

Things You Should Know is a free service designed to keep you on task with your academic studies.

We try and keep the service as clean as possible, and only include information about academics and things that, well, you should know about!

That's why TYSK has a WhatsApp group chat for important and medium-priority announcements. Although not mandatory, it is strongly recommended you join. However, by having a separate group chat, it keeps the main chat uncluttered. You will also be able to turn off notifications for the Announcements group chat while keeping them on for the main group chat.

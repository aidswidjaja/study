# Things You Should Know is a free service to help you stay on top of your assessments, events and co-curricular activities.

## • when Assessment Notifications come out
## • when Assessments are due
## • when you need to study for Exams
## • when Excursions and Events occur

Things You Should Know can help you stay on top of your assessments, events and co-curricular activities. Our volunteer-driven and independent service pushes notifications through WhatsAppto remind you when Assessment Notifications come out, when Assessments are due, when you need to study for exams, and other things you should know about. Please be advised Things You Should Know is a student-run service that is not affiliated with the school, and you are encouraged to also keep track of your own schedules and events, as we are also humans and can forget things too. Join the service at [tinyurl.com/AloysTYSK](https://tinyurl.com/AloysTYSK). This is a voluntary service; no warranties provided. You can leave the group at any time. Elective subject info may not be covered due to lack of information.

Things You Should Know is a free service designed to keep you on task with your academic studies.

We try and keep the service as clean as possible, and only include information about academics and things that, well, you should know about!

That's why TYSK has a WhatsApp group chat for important and medium-priority announcements. Although not mandatory, it is strongly recommended you join. However, by having a separate group chat, it keeps the main chat uncluttered. You will also be able to turn off notifications for the Announcements group chat while keeping them on for the main group chat.

## Get started with TYSK on Email

TYSK uses Google Groups to distribute emails. It is an easy and reliable way to send notifications. It also has the added benefit of allowing people to visit the Google Groups page to view past notifications without having to search through their inbox.

Make sure your email settings are turned on in order to receive our notifications. Press the User Settings dropdown (a person next to a cog) and click Membership and Email Settings to get emails sent at your preference.

If you're using Gmail you can set up individual labels and features to ensure that emails aren't delegated by Gmail to the "Forums" tab. Visit the [TYSK Help page](https://adrian-study-club.netlify.com/tysk.html#use-things-you-should-know-on-email) for more.

### View the TYSK Calendar

You can view an assessment schedule Google Calendar here, [at this link](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=3s2njvh3m3sulttuinhvmscbj4%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=Australia%2FSydney). You can also integrate it with iCal by going to File >> New Calendar Subscription... and pasting https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/3s2njvh3m3sulttuinhvmscbj4%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics as your URL.

### View older notifications

Instead of looking through your emails to find previous notifications, you can use this Google Groups interface, available [here](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/tysk-aloys), to find past notifications.

### Volunteer to help TYSK

You can volunteer in a number of ways.

1. Join the TYSK Staff Team and send out notifications for everybody, or manage the TYSK Calendar.
2. Send a school provided assessment notification [to this email address](https://adrian-study-club.netlify.com/tysk.html#use-things-you-should-know-on-email) for Elective subjects or Maths 5.2, so we can add it to the TYSK Calendar and provide TYSK notifications for it.

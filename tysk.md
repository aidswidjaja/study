*This webpage is for close friends who don't know about the service, or friends outside of Aloys to learn about what I do and how they can implement a similar service at their school.*

# Things You Should Know is a free service to help you stay on top of your assessments, events and co-curricular activities.

## • when Assessment Notifications come out
## • when Assessments are due
## • when you need to study for Exams
## • when Excursions and Events occur

Things You Should Know can help you stay on top of your assessments, events and co-curricular activities. Our volunteer-driven and independent service pushes notifications through WhatsApp to remind you when Assessment Notifications come out, when Assessments are due, when you need to study for exams, and other things you should know about. Please be advised Things You Should Know is a student-run service that is not affiliated with the school, and you are encouraged to also keep track of your own schedules and events, as we are also humans and can forget things too. Join the service at [tinyurl.com/AloysTYSK](https://tinyurl.com/AloysTYSK). This is a voluntary service; no warranties provided. You can leave the group at any time. Elective subject info may not be covered due to lack of information.

TYSK also has a WhatsApp group chat for important and medium-priority announcements. Although not mandatory, it is strongly recommended you join. However, by having a separate group chat, it keeps the main chat uncluttered. You will also be able to turn off notifications for the Announcements group chat while keeping them on for the main group chat.

### View the TYSK Calendar

You can view an assessment schedule on Google Calendar here, [at this link](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=3s2njvh3m3sulttuinhvmscbj4%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=Australia%2FSydney). You can also integrate it with iCal by going to File >> New Calendar Subscription... and pasting `https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/3s2njvh3m3sulttuinhvmscbj4%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics` as your URL.

### Volunteer to help TYSK

You can volunteer in a number of ways.

1. Join the TYSK Staff Team and send out notifications for everybody, or manage the TYSK Calendar.
2. Send a school provided assessment notification [to this email address](https://adrian-study-club.netlify.com/tysk.html#use-things-you-should-know-on-email) for Elective subjects or Maths 5.2, so we can add it to the TYSK Calendar and provide TYSK notifications for it.

### What does DROM mean on TYSK Calendar?

DROM stands for "Don't Rely on Me". This means that it is solely based on the information provided in the assessment schedule and can't be independently verified by TYSK. If you'd like to cover a specific elective/Maths 5.2, or make a correction, please message an admin on WhatsApp!

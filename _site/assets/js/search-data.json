Hey there! Please be advised if you’re an Aloys boi this doesn’t exactly match your textbook! I’ve tried to keep similar concepts together so if you can’t find something, feel free to use the textbook, or use that neat little search bar up the top there! Thanks! . . Model of an atom . Model of an atom: . Small and dense nucleus made up of: neutrons (uncharged particles) | protons (positively charged particles) | | Surrounded by rapidly moving electrons | Held together through nuclear forces | Particles with the same charge repel each other. Particles with opposite charges are attracted to each other. . Most volume of the electron is made up of empty space. . Electrons == 1/2000th size of protons and neutrons. | Electrons have electrical charge of -1 | Protons have electrical charge of +1 | Neutrons have no electrical charge | Atoms usually have the same number of electrons as neutrons | Electrons move rapidly around the nucleus, in regions known as electron shells . | In the nucleus: protons and neutrons | Surrounding the nucleus: electrons | . The number of protons in an atom determines what type of atom it is . e.g gold atom has 79 protons . . Electrons . and the 2, 8, 18 rule . Electrons fill electron shells. The number of electrons a shell can fit increases as the shell’s distance from the nucleus increases. The outermost shell is called the valence shell. . The numnber of electrons a shell can hold is equal to 2n^2 where n is the shell number. . Therefore: . 2 × 1^2 = 2 (for shell one) 2 × 2^2 = 8 (for shell two) 2 × 3^2 = 18 (for shell three) . and so on. This is called the 2, 8, 18 rule. Electrons fill from the inner most shell going outwards. You can see a diagramatic representation on this electron dot diagram. . The 2, 8, 18 rule has some caveats though. See Shells! for more information. . . Examples of electron configurations . Aluminium has 13 protons, therefore aluminium’s electron configuration is 2, 8, 3 . Sodium has 11 protons, therefore sodium’s electron configuration is 2, 8, 1 . Oxygen has 8 protons, therefore sodium’s electron configuration is 2, 6 . Excited atoms . When an atom is excited it may “jump” to a higher electron shell. They drop back down and release light energy. . Groups in the Periodic Table . There are 18 groups in the periodic table. Here are some important ones. . Group Name Other     . Group 1 | Alkali metals | React strongly with water to form basic solutions |   |   | . Group 2 | Alkaline earth metals | Highly reactive |   |   | . Group 17 | Halogens | Non-metal elements |   |   | . Group 18 | Noble gases | Inert elements that aren’t that reactive |   |   | . Group 3-12 | Transition metals | Metallic elements |   |   | . . Atomic numbers and mass numbers . Atomic number . We know that the number of protons an atom has dictates what atom it is. In the periodic table, this is known as the atomic number. . Number of protons == Number of electrons == Atomic number e.g Chlorine has 17 protons therefore it&#39;s atomic number is 17 . Atoms are electrically neutral and must have the same number of electrons as protons. Otherwise, they become ions. . Mass number . Mass number == number of protons + number of neutrons . Electrons are too small to be counted. . Subatomic particles . You can represent the mass number and atomic number of an element like this: . . where: . A is the atomic number | Z is the mass number, and | E is the element symbol. | . For example, for the element iron, . . You can use this information to calculate the number of neutrons… number of neutrons = A − Z = 56 − 26 = 30 . … and the number of electrons or the number of protons. number of electrons = number of protons = Z = 26 . . The Periodic Table . Metalloids are elements that have properties of both metals and non-metals. On the periodic table they sort of zig zag. There are more cool patterns too… . Characteristic Pattern down a group Pattern across a period . Atomic number and mass number | Increases | Increases | . Atomic radius | Increases | Decreases | . Melting points | Decreases for groups 1 to 5 and increases for groups 5 to 8 | Generally increases then decreases | . Reactivity | Metals become more reactive and non-metals become less reactive | Is high, then decreases and then increases. Group 8 elements are inert and do not react. | . Metallic character | Increases | Decreases | . Shells! . The largest atoms have up to seven electron shells, therefore, there are seven periods. | The period tells you the number of electron shells. | The third shell can hold up to 18 electrons but any shell with more than 8 electrons become unstable. Therefore, after 8 electrons the fourth shell starts to fill. | From scandium to zinc (21 - 30) which are transition metals, the third shell fills, and then the fourth shell continues to fill up. | . Valencies . You need to know your valencies in the periodic table. You can write valencies above the group on your periodic table, or refer to this table. . Group Valency . Group 1 | 1 | . Group 2 | 2 | . Group 3 | 3 | . Group 4, group 14 | 4 | . Group 15 | 3 | . Group 16 | 2 | . Group 17 | 1 | . This will be really helpful for naming chemical formulas of ionic and covalent compounds later on. . . Ions . Ions are atoms that have gained or lost electrons. It means they have an electric charge. Positive ions have more protons than electrons, and vice versa. When the outer shell is filled atoms tend to be more stable (which is why it’s cool to be noble – elements with full valence electrons). . For example, a sodium atom might need to lose an electron to have a full valence shell, and a chloride atom might need to gain an electron to have a full valence shell. The sodium atom can lose an electron to the chloride atom and now both atoms have full valence shells. . Naming ions . Positive ions are called cations, while negative ions are called anions. Cations keep their original name (e.g boron, lithium, etc) while negative ions have the -ide suffix (e.g flouride, nitride, etc). . Common ions . Atom name Ion name Chemical symbol Atom name Ion name Chemical symbol . lithium | lithium | Li+ | iodine | iodide | I− | . sodium | sodium | Na+ | fluorine | fluoride | F− | . potassium | potassium | K+ | chlorine | chloride | Cl− | . calcium | calcium | Ca2+ | oxygen | oxide | O2− | . aluminium | aluminium | Al3+ | nitrogen | nitride | N3− | . Ionic compounds . The outer electrons of atoms interact with other electrons, and the become chemically joined to form molecules. | This is known as a chemical bond. | Molecules between atoms of different elements become a compound. | Noble gases with stable electron configurations and full valence shells don’t react to form compounds. | Compounds where atoms lose and gain electrons are called ionic compounds. | Sodium chloride, copper sulfate and calcium carbonate are examples of ionic compounds. | Ionic compounds occur where metal and non-metal atoms combine. This creates an ionic bond.ionic | . . Ionic compounds usually: . are made up of positive and negative ions | are solids at room temperature | dave high melting points | dissolve in water | when dissolved to become an aqueous solution, this soltuion is usually conductive to electricity | Naming an ionic compound1 . You can solve for a metal and a non-metal’s ionic compound chemical formula using the cross method. . REMEMBER: Cations first! . Explanation2 . Find the chemical formula for iron(III) bromide. . NB: Note that electrovalency, valency, and charges are sometimes interchangably. They are similar but not the same. NOTICE that iron is a metal and bromide is a non-metal. . To determine the formula of an ionic compound, you need to balance the charges (electrovalencies). Compounds have to be electrically neutral. To do this: . Find electrovalencies of the ions in the compound. For example: Iron has a charge of +3 Bromide has a charge of -1 | Figure out how many negative ions you need to balance out positive ions, and vice versa. To balance out iron&#39;s charge of +3, you need 3 bromide ions. Therefore, 1x iron ion charge of single iron(III) ion == +3 total charge of 1x iron ion == +3 3x bromide ion charge of single bromide ion == -1 total charge of 3x bromide ion == -3 ∴ iron total charge of +3 balances with bromide total charge of -3 . | Write the formula. One iron ion, three bromide ions ∴ FeBr₃ is the chemical formula for iron(III) bromide | Crossover method . An easy method to determine ionic compound formulae. . Take a metal and a non-metal. For this example, we will use magnesium and chloride. | Write their corresponding valencies without + or - under them. For example, magnesium’s valency is +2 and chloride’s valency is -1. | “Cross over” these valencies. Therefore, we end in MgCl2. Mg Cl +2 -1 2 1 # cross over MgCl2 . | Remember, the elements need to achieve electrical neutrality. How many Cl ions do you need to neutralise Mg? . Monoatomic ions such as aluminium ion, oxide ion and sodium ion contain one symbol. If you receive a radical or a group of atoms with one singular charge it is known as a polyatomic ion. These include nitrate (NO₃ - overall charge 1-), sulfate (SO₄ - overall charge 2-) and phosphate (PO₄ - overall charge 3-) . QUICK NOTE: Radicals are groups of atoms with an overall charge. . See the example below for a demonstration on hwo to deal with polyatomic ions. . Examples . . Covalent compounds . Atoms can share electrons to create a covalent bond. Covalent molecules can be between more than one type of atom or atoms of the same element. For example, oxygen gas (O2) is made up of two oxygen atoms sharing electrons. . Elements combine and share electrons to achieve full electron shells. Here are some common covalent molecules. . . Covalent compounds usually: . are gases, liquids, or solids with low melting points | aren’t electrically conductive | insolube in water | Naming a covalent compound . . Balancing chemical equations . While it may be easy to write word equations like . Magnesium metal + hydrochloric acid –&gt; hydrogen gas + magnesium chloride . writing chemical equations are a bit different. . Here, have an easy one. . H₂ + O₂ –&gt; H₂O . The reactant side (H₂ + O₂) has one more oxygen atom than the product side (H₂O). Therefore, we need to multiply the atoms to balance the equation. . We do that by writing a number in front of a formula, which multiplies ALL of the atoms in that formula by that number. For example, if we write 2 in front of the hydrogen gas on the reactant side and water on the product side… . 2H₂ + O₂ –&gt; 2H₂O . Suddenly we have balanced the equations. Now, there are 4 hydrogen and 2 oxygen on each side. . Here are some more fun ones to do. Use the table for common ionic and covalent compounds. Answers are below. . Activity . Carbon monoxide gas + oxygen gas –&gt; carbon dioxide gas | Sodium hydroxide + hydrochloric acid –&gt; sodium chloride + water | Mercury + oxygen gas –&gt; mercury(II) oxide | Magnesium metal + hydrochloric acid –&gt; hydrogen gas + magnesium chloride | Sodium + water –&gt; hydrogen gas + sodium hydroxide gas | Copper sulfate + sodium hydroxide –&gt; copper hydroxie + sodium sulfate | Common ionic and covalent compounds .

    "title": "In a Nutshell: How Neurons Work Together",
    "content": "How Neurons Work Together . part of the In a Nutshell series on Adrian’s Study Club . Complete . When a stimulus is presented, there are a number of processes that takes effect before a response is initiated. Take a humble bumblebee buzzing around. According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly. Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. However, for this example, we’ll assume that the bee is in fact, flying around and being a general annoyance to someone like Barry. . Firstly, Barry’s sensory neurons (in this case, a photoreceptor) sees the bee. Barry’s photoreceptor is a part of the Peripheral Nervous System. It sees the bee and sends nerve impulses (electrical signals) which reach the brain, through interneurons. These interneurons are part of Barry’s Central Nervous System, which consists of the brain and the spinal cord. This area coordinates all of Barry’s activities and what Barry does with this information. The brain has many different types of neurons, too much for Barry to possibly comprehend! . Secondly, the sensory neurons connect to the motor neurons via interneurons. They transfer information between the sensory neurons and the motor neurons. Finally, the nerve impulse, carried over many neurotransmitters, synapses, and neurons, is brought to the motor neuron, through the spinal cord (which has a lot of nerve cells). . The motor neuron controls our muscles and organs. For Barry, it’s the motor neurons that tell his arm to swat the bee away. There are upper motor neurons that travel from the brain to the spinal cord, and the lower motor neurons which travel from the spinal cord to the muscles. . 🐝 . © 🥜🐚 .",

Interconnections these days are fueled by the ever growing technological advancements that are being produced these days. . The Internet has been a major proponent of Interconnections, which have been important to the idea of connecting with people on the other side of the world in real time. Containerisation has allowed deliveries to be performed quicker than usual, cutting down on costs and expanding international trading routes. . These sort of interconnections have allowed us to interconnect like never before. While interconnections are predominantly a good thing, they have also hurt us, with things such as expanding criminal activity from a domestic scale to an international scale, the result of tourism destroying the environment, and many more things. . Interconnections do not have to be international, in fact usually they are seen on a local scale. For example, you are interconnected with your community, with your local council serving as a hub, and with your local council connected to the state government which is connected to the federal government etc. etc. .",

    "title": "Landforms and Landscapes",
    "content": "Landforms and Landscapes . Complete . A landscape is part of the Earth’s landform. It consists of a variety of geographical features that may be characteristic of that area in particular. . There are many different types of landscapes, including mountain landscapes (which feature mountains created by tectonic plates), coastal landscapes where a land area comes into correct contact with the sea, and riverine landscapes where there is a water system that flows through it such as a creek, stream or river. Desert landscapes have a specific definition, that is, that only 250 mm or less rain falls onto the area per year. Karst landscapes are formed when easily dissolvable bedrock, or the rock directly a land surface such as limestone, is worn away by water that is slightly acidic. Finally, human landscapes are artificial landscapes created by humans, such as city skylines and schools. . While a landscape covers a certain area featuring similar characteristics, a landform is a specific feature in a landscape. Example of landforms in a mountain landscape include mountain ranges, mountains, ridges, glaciers and volcanos. . Many natural and human landscapes are formed and transformed by many different processes, including geomorphic, hydrological, and atmospheric processes. You are about to explore four of the geomorphic processes that form and transform the Earth: tectonic activity, erosion, deposition and weathering. To understand these processes, you first need to know about the world beneath your feet. . You may be used to thinking of the Earth as a solid ball like a giant shot-put, but in fact this is far from reality. The Earth is more like a giant peach with a skin that is very thin and a core at the centre surrounded by it’s soft flesh. Scientists believe that the Earth is made up of four layers. . The outer layer of the Earth’s surface, which is the crust, is broken into large pieces called tectonic plates. These plates are around 100 kilometers thick and fit together like enormous pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. Currents in the red-hot molten material under these tectonic plates cause them to move about. . In some places, these tectonic places are being pushed into one another. This is called converging, and it creates mountains. .",

However, with finals approaching close and our lack of neccessity for learning about Roman numerals, migration to the new platform will be done from topics of most importance to topics of least importance. This also means that topic areas from previous years that don’t get covered now won’t be prioritised as much. . Please note that Extra Resources don’t have a roadmap, however, while most important things like Past Papers are online as soon as possible, others will take time. Expected completion date for Google Drive organisation: Next year Term 1 . Personally I wish we could organise the chapters into concepts. However, that would unnecessarily take a lot of time and the search function + chapter headings already detail something if you wanted to find it. We also seriously recommend using BBC Bitesize. If you’d like to volunteer to volunteer moving chapter headings into concepts (which requires merging Year 7 stuff with Year 9 stuff for example) please let me know. We might consider merging in the future but it isn’t high priority right now. . Also consider making your own written study notes as well. Most of this stuff is written in your workbooks/summary books and this just serves as a digital record of the work we do in class. . The roadmap allows us to keep track of what needs to be completed, what has already been completed and what is most important for completion. You can view each subject’s roadmap on it’s parent page. For example, for the Maths roadmap, you would click on the Maths parent page. . If you’d like to contribute and help out, please email me!

Alternatively, the topic/chapter never had any work done on it, and if it was from 2017/2018 it probably won’t ever be completed. On the old Google Doc the term redundant means that it wasn’t finished by the time it was required and so we stopped working to finish it. Here, it has a different definition. **Note that for some chapters the redundant label won’t be used and they will just be left out of their corresponding subject’s roadmap entirely. . Incomplete – The topic/chapter hasn’t been finished and isn’t being updated in the foreseeable future. Not to be confused with In-Progress. . Planned – The topic/chapter is planned to be worked on sometime in the foreseeable future but hasn’t started yet. .

Earth is made up of tectonic plates; plates of crust that float on the mantle. Here’s a table of the different parts of the Earth. . Part of the Earth Description . Crust | Thin and rocky | . Mantle | Semi-molten rock | . Outer Core | Liquid nickel and iron | . Inner Core | Solid nickel and iron | . Sometimes we refer to them in regions. . Part of the Earth Description . Lithosphere | Made up of crust and upper mantle | . Aesthenosphere | Below the lithosphere | . Earth’s crust is a thin and rocky section of the Earth that is about 8km thick. It floats on top of semi-molten rock in the mantle, which in turn floats on nickel and iron. . Wegener’s Theory of Continental Drift . Alfred Wegener theorised that the Earth’s crust was made up of plates that were floating on denser magma. This was called the theory of continental drift. Today, the theory of tectonic plates succeeds continental drift theory. He also theorised that the continents of the world used to be one gigantic supercontinent, which he named Pangea. There were a number of different supercontinents as land broke away and joined together repeatedly. . . Evidence for the theory of continental drift . Evidence for this includes: . The east coast of South America and the west coast of South America match up together | There are similar patterns for rocks on different continents (e.g the Appalachian Mountains in North America seem to continue into the Caledonian Mountains in Scandinavia) | Similar fossils have been found on different continents, for example, fossils of the Mesosaurus have been found in both in both South Africa and Brazil. Cold areas such as Greenland have tropical fossils, and South Africa has ice scratches on rocks despite it’s warm climate. | There are coal deposits in cold parts of the world (such as Antarctica) and glacial deposits in hot parts of the world (such as South Africa, Australia, South America and India) which seems to suggest that these landmasses were once joined together. | Tectonic and seismic activity seems to concentrate on the boundaries of the plates, known as the Ring of Fire. | The magnetic north pole continually moved around1 | Tectonic activity is the reason that our natural terrain is extremely varied. The Mid-Ocean Ridge and Marianas Trench are some examples of terrain formed by a divergent boundary and a convergent boundary respectively. The San Andreas Fault in California is a good example of a transform boundary. . . Moooooove over! . How do plates move? . Plates move in three primary ways2. . Divergent Boundaries . Divergent boundaries are when two plates separate and move away from each other. . | Convergent Boundaries . Convergent boundaries are when two plates move towards each other, forcing one plate to dive beneath the other. This process is known as subduction. . | Transform Boundaries . Transform boundaries are when two plates slide past each other, causing a fault. A good example of a transform boundary is the San Andreas Fault in California, United States. . | Why do plates move? . Plates move because of convection currents in the molten liquid rock in the mantle. . . Heat generated from the really hot outer core rises, and when it gets to the top, is blocked by the crust, spreads out at the top, and falls when it begins to cool. This moves the boundaries of the plates. As a result, the crust is affected by changing boundaries and this is what causes magma to upwell, usually at the site of divergent boundary (volcanic activity). . History of Tectonic Plates1 . Alfred Wegener proposed the theory of continental drift, and that continents “plower This was due to the geographical evidence where coastlines fit together. Paleontologists – fossil scientists, found fossils on different continents. Moving into the present, underwater seisometers meant to alert nuclear activity showed that there was increased volcanic and seismic activity around the edges of plates. This, which occurred in the 1960s, basically made plate tectonic theory the dominant accepted theory for how the Earth was shaped. . . Folds, Faults and Subduction . Folding3 . Earth’s crust bends, and this causes folding | When plates collide and are forced into each other, folding occurs. This process is known as compression. | Horizontal compression occurs which creates mountains. | This process occurs at collision zones. | . . In folding mountains, the part folded upwards is the anticline and the part folded downwards is the syncline. . . . More on Fold Mountains on BBC Bitesize GCSE Geography . Faults . Tectonic plates horizontally slip | This process is known as rifting, where the lithosphere is torn apart | . In fault-block mountains, the raised block is the horst while the lowered block is the graben. . . Subduction4 . Destructive Plate Margins on BBC Bitesize . A geological process at convergent boundaries, where one plate dives under another | Most common with an oceanic plate, and a continental plate | The oceanic plate is denser, and it moves below the continental plate | This triggers earthquakes | This process occurs at the subduction zone. | . . When subduction occurs, it usually means that crust will be subducted too. This means that mantle from the asthenosphere will be upwelled to form new crust. . . Earthquakes . Seismic and volcanic activity are more likely at the boundaries of tectonic plates. Most of the sliding, pushing, pulling, seafloor spreading and upwelling occurs along the tectonic plates. A large number of earthquakes and volcanic activity occur around the Pacific Plate. This is known as the Ring of Fire. . . We can measure how much energy an earthquake produces using the Richter scale, which is a scale of magnitude. Every increase of 1 on the scale is an increase of amplitude by 10. Familiarise yourself with the Richter scale now. . Magnitude Description Mercalli intensity Average earthquake effects Average frequency of occurrence globally (estimated) . 1.0–1.9 | Micro | I | Microearthquakes, not felt, or felt rarely. Recorded by seismographs.[30] | Continual/several million per year | . 2.0–2.9 | Minor | I to II | Felt slightly by some people. No damage to buildings. | Over one million per year | . 3.0–3.9 |   | III to IV | Often felt by people, but very rarely causes damage. Shaking of indoor objects can be noticeable. | Over 100,000 per year | . 4.0–4.9 | Light | IV to VI | Noticeable shaking of indoor objects and rattling noises. Felt by most people in the affected area. Slightly felt outside. Generally causes none to minimal damage. Moderate to significant damage very unlikely. Some objects may fall off shelves or be knocked over. | 10,000 to 15,000 per year | . 5.0–5.9 | Moderate | VI to VII | Can cause damage of varying severity to poorly constructed buildings. At most, none to slight damage to all other buildings. Felt by everyone. | 1,000 to 1,500 per year | . 6.0–6.9 | Strong | VIII to X | Damage to a moderate number of well-built structures in populated areas.Earthquake-resistant structuressurvive with slight to moderate damage. Poorly designed structures receive moderate to severe damage. Felt in wider areas; up to hundreds of miles/kilometers from the epicenter. Strong to violent shaking in epicentral area. | 100 to 150 per year | . 7.0–7.9 | Major | X or greater | Causes damage to most buildings, some to partially or completely collapse or receive severe damage. Well-designed structures are likely to receive damage. Felt across great distances with major damage mostly limited to 250 km from epicenter. | 10 to 20 per year | . 8.0–8.9 | Great |   | Major damage to buildings, structures likely to be destroyed. Will cause moderate to heavy damage to sturdy or earthquake-resistant buildings. Damaging in large areas. Felt in extremely large regions. | One per year | . 9.0 and greater |   |   | At or near total destruction – severe damage or collapse to all buildings. Heavy damage and shaking extends to distant locations. Permanent changes in ground topography. | One per 10 to 50 years | . . Tsunamis . Many earthquakes occur underwater. When earthquakes occur, they can trigger waves. Waves travel long distances, and as the water gets shallower, the waves slow down. Then, they become higher and more closely packed. Adrian personally suggests you to check Tsunamis on BBC Bitesize for a better understanding! . Tsunamis on BBC Bitesize GCSE Edexcel . . . Lava and Magma . NOTE: Volcanoes will remain somewhat Redundant because it isn’t being covered at Adrian’s school. If you’d like to contribute, feel free to. Otherwise, please check out BBC Bitesize’s information on volcanoes . . Volcanoes are formed when magma escapes through cracks in the crust and spews out as lava. . Magma is molten rock. Then, when it escapes, it cools down and hardens as lava. . . Straya . Australia lies in the centre of the Australian plate, which keeps it relatively immune from seismic and volcanic activity. As the mainland is not near any plate boundaries it doesn’t occur near Australia a lot. This makes Australia quite a stable continent. . ** . Footnotes and Other Notes .

Investment in a nutshell . Businesses, governments and individuals carry out investment. There are many different type of investment, including: . savings account | term deposits | shares | cash management account | managed fund | property | superannuation | debentures and unsecured notes | . Financing an investment can be done either through personal savings or borrowing. Advantages of saving for an investment means no interest is paid, but you might had to have extra costs (e.g paying rent while saving for a house) . Loans have different features. Personal loans can be secured or unsecured. Home loans can either have a fixed interest rate or a variable interest rate. . A fixed interest rate is a constant rate. The repayment amount is always the same. . A variable interest rate moves up or down depending on the market. A variable rate continually changes and fluctuates. This is usually done through the RBA. . An income and expenditure account is a record of income earned and money spent during the previous week. Take a look at an example below: . Date Income Amount Date Expense Amount . 1 Jul | Balance available to invest | $30.00 | 1 Jul | Rent | $60.00 | . 1 Jul | Pay for casual work | $200.00 | 2 Jul | Magazine | $8.00 | . 3 Jul | Medicare refund | $17.00 | 4 Jul | Groceries | $27.00 | . 6 Jul | Interest on deposit | $47.00 | 5 Jul | Donated to Red Cross | $5.00 | .   | Total income | $294.00 | 7 Jul | Mobile phone | $20.00 | . ……. | ………………………………… | ……….. |   | Total expenses | $120.00 | .   |   |   | 7 Jul | Balance available to invest | $174.00 | .   |   |   | ……. | ……………………………….. | ……… | . 8 Jul | Balance available to invest | $174.00 | 8 Jul | Rent | $60.00 | . 8 Jul | Pay for casual work | $208.00 | 9 Jul | Groceries | $29.00 | . 12 Jul | Medicare refund | $20.00 | 11 Jul | Doctor bills | $18.00 | . 14 Jul | Birthday gift | $50.00 | 11 Jul | New fishing rod | $50.00 | .   | Total income | $452.00 | 12 Jul | Newspaper bill | $18.00 | .   |   |   | 13 Jul | Entertainment | $36.00 | .   |   |   | 14 Jul | Petrol for car | $23.00 | .   |   |   |   | Total expenses | $234.00 | .   | Balance available to invest | $218.00 | 14 Jul | Balance available to invest | $218.00 | . . Ethical investments . Investors might only choose to make investments ethically. This is known as ethical investment . This can be done in two ways: . Negative screening: avoids investment in some firms such as cigarette or alcohol companies | Positive screening: limits investing to desirable firms such as renewable energy or healthcare | Case Study 1 . Tassal is a company operating in Tasmania that produces sustainable and environmentally friendly fish. In addition to their strong emphasis on being environmentally friendly, it develops local community support programs and offers scholarships to students studying aquaculture. . Case Study 2 . Bendigo Bank’s Community Bank Program allows those in rural and remote areas to have access to normal banking, which allows communities the right to operate a Bendgo Bank franchise branch. Revenue is shared between the company and the community, and Bendigo Bank provides banking support. .",

This unit of work covers: . Investment accounts | Shares | Property | Managed funds | Superannuation | Debentures and unsecured notes | Investment accounts . Many financial institutions including banks, building societies and credit unions offer investment accounts. This includes: . cash management accounts | internet accounts | term deposits | . In cash management accounts, you can deposit and withdraw funds whenever you want, and it has a high rate of interest. However, a substantial minimum amount must be kept (e.g $5000). Internet accounts are only accessed through the internet with high interest rates and low fees, but can have it’s limitations. Term deposits are sums of money deposited with a financial institution that has to be left there for a set period of time to receive higher interest rates. No withdrawal or deposit can occur to keep the high interest rates. It offers a reasonable level of return. . Shares . Shares are part ownership of a public company, bought and sold on a stock exchange. Selling the share when the price is higher than when you bought it can gain you a profit!!! . Shareholders can also receive dividends which are part of the firm’s profits that is divided amongst shareholders. . Usually people use stockbrokers to buy and sell shares, but you can also use a internet broker e.g CommSec. . Property . Property values can appreciate, or can generate extra income (e.g rent). Although saving up to purchase a property can incur additional fees (eg paying rent while saving) once you do you might not need to pay rent. . Managed fund . A pool of money sourced from many people with similar investment goals. It is managed by a fund manager. . Superannuation . A managed fund that saves up for retirement benefits. It is compulsory in Australia. Employees and employers contribute money to a superannuation fund. . Debenture and unsecured notes . A debenture is a legal document issued by a firm when you lend it a sum of money. It is a relatively save investment. . Unsecured notes are similar but they aren’t as safe. As opposed to debentures, unsecured notes will be the last to be repaid if a firm is liquidated. They attract a higher rate of interest. .",

To expand brackets, use the distributive law. . a(b + c) = a × b + a × c = ab + ac a(b + c) = a × b - a × c = ab - ac . You can express this using visual representation. . . To the contrary, you can factorise expressions to make them shorter. . Firstly, find the highest common factor (HCF), and then place that outside the brackets. Dividing each term by it, leaving the results in brackets, while using the appropriate operation. . For example, 10x + 15y has a HCF of 5, thus, in it’s factorised form, would be 5(2x + 3y). .

This section is more advanced, and omits algebraic language, basic operations, distributive law, and other basic concepts. It is also suggested you read about Algebraic techniques. For more advanced stuff, you should refer to Year 9 Maths Chapter 2. This section is more basic and omits simulataneous equations . Linear equations are when the power of the pronumeral is 1 and there is only one solution. Another type of equation is the simple quadratic equation, which can be expressed as such: . x^2 = c . The power of the pronumeral is 2. Depending on the value of c, x can have zero to many solutions. . x^2 = c is a simple quadratic equation. If c &gt; 0, then your solutions are as follows: . x = √c | X= -√c | . If c = 0 there is one solution, which is x = 0. . However, if c &lt; 0 then there aren’t any solutions because x^2 is always positive. . An inequality is a statement of the form: . LHS &gt; RHS - greater than - 7 &gt; 2 | LHS ≥ RHS - greater than or equal to - 7 ≥ 7, 7 ≥ 2 | LHS &lt; RHS - less than - 2 &lt; 7 | LHS ≤ RHS - less than or equal to - 2 ≤ 2, 2 ≤ 7 | . Inequalities can be reversed, for example, x &lt; 3 and 3 &gt; x is equivalent. They can also be represented on a number line, as follows. . . As you can see, the number line is on the x axis, with an arrow above the corresponding numbers. For example, in the first example, you can see that x is larger or equal to than five. As it is inclusive of five, there is a filled circle. On the contrary, with a statement that lacks the ‘or equal to’ statement, it is exclusive, like in the second example, where 6 is excluded, thus the open circle. . Tl;dr: If the statement contains an ‘or equal to’ statement within the inequality, then the circle is open. Otherwise, it is closed. . A range can be represented as a segment on the number line. . Solving inequalities can be performed by finding an equivalent inequality to the given. . Adding or subtracting an expression from both sides | Multiplying or dividing both sides by any positive number | Multiplying or dividing both sides by a negative number AND reversing the inequality symbol | Swapping LHS and RHS and reversing the inequality symbol | . The above represent methods in which an equivalent inequality can be obtained. . . Problem solving - Two people painting a wall . You can use equations to answer a question such as the following: . Kingston prepares a rabbit for sacrifice in 8 hours. Oscar does that in 6 hours. If Kingston and Oscar worked together, how long would it take to sacrifice a rabbit? . Answer: . Kingston prepares ⅛ of a rabbit in 1 hour. Oscar prepares ⅙ of a rabbit in 1 hour. ∴ together, they prepare ⅛ + ⅙ of a rabbit in 1 hour. ⅛ + ⅙ = 3/24 + 4/24 = 7/24 of a rabbit in 1 hour . Therefore: . One sacrificed rabbit = 24/7 . Unfortunately there doesn’t seem to be one easy way to explain why we flip the fraction. You idiot its because you have to divide it by 7 hours to get 1 hour worth of rabbits . Or! . Kingston prepares 3 rabbits in 24 hours Oscar prepares 4 rabbits in 24 hours ∴ together, they prepare (3 + 4) rabbits in 24 hours. 3 + 4 = 7 = 7 rabbits in 24 hours . Therefore: . One sacrifice rabbit = 24/7 .",

Table of Contents . 2D Shapes | 3D Shapes | Capacity and volume | Pythag | . . 2D Shapes . Special quadrilaterals include the parallelogram, rhombus, the kite and the trapezium. The formula for each 2D shape slightly varies. . Depending on your personal preference, you may use either the Textbook formula or the Standard formula. . Textbook formula is as follows: . Parallelogram - Base x Height (A = bh) Rhombus and Kite - ½ x Diagonal x x Diagonal y (A = ½ xy) Trapezium - ½ x Sum of parallel sides x Height (A = ½ h(a + b) . However, you may prefer the Standard formula: . Parallelogram - A = bh where b is the base and h is the height Rhombus and Kite - A = pq/2 where p and q each represent diagonals Trapezium - A = ½ h(a + b) or A = ab/2 h where a and b are the sum of parallel sides and where h is the height . The ratio of the area of a circle to the square of its radius is equal to π. Therefore, the area of a circle is known as πr2 where r is the radius. . A half circle is known as a semi circle, and a quarter circle is known as a quadrant. Therefore, their respective area formulas are ½ πr2 and ¼ πr2. . A sector is formed by dividing a circle with two radii (radii is plural for radius) . A sector’s area can be determined by calculating a fraction of the area of a circle with the same radius. Let ‘θ’ be the angle inside the sector. . Fraction = θ/360 Sector area = θ/360 x πr2 . A 2D composite shape is a shape that is composed of more than one basic shape (circle, square, triangle, etc.) . Here are your basic shapes: . . And here is a composite shape, that can be split into multiple parts: . . The figure above, which we will call ‘N’, is made up of different size rectangles and squares. . The area of N, or any composite shape for the matter, can be found by adding or subtracting the areas of more basic shapes. . . 3D Shapes . A prism is a polyhedron (solid figure with multiple faces) with a constant cross-section. . The cross section is parallel to the two identical, congruent ends. The other sides are parallelograms or rectangles. . The volume of a prism, where V is the volume, A is the area of the cross section and h is the perpendicular height is: . V = Ah . The volume of a cylinder is: . V = πr2h . A net is a 2D representation of all surfaces unfolded. When folded, it forms the desired 3D outcome. . The surface area of a prism is the sum of the areas of all it’s faces. For example, a cube x with squares y, each with a side length of z would be calculated as: . A = 6z2 . . Capacity and volume . Volume is measured in cubic units. . Cubic millimeters (mm3) [1000mm3 is equal to 1 milliliter] | Cubic centimeter (cm3) [1cm3 is equal to 1 milliliter] | Cubic meter (m3) [1m3 is equal to 1000 litres which is equal to 1 kilolitre] | . Conversions for volume are as followed . x10003 x1003 x103 km3 -&gt; m3 -&gt; cm3 --&gt; mm3 /10003 / 1003 /103 . Capacity is the volume of liquids or gas that containers hold. In the metric system (the system that literally everyone except for the Americans use, oh wait, that’s celsius), there are some common units you should remember. . Millilitre (mL) | Litre (L) | Kilolitre (kL) | Megalitre (ML) | . Some common conversions mentioned above might make more sense now. . 1mL = 1cm3 | 1 L = 1000mL | 1 kL = 1000L = 1m3 | . To find the volume of a rectangular prism, you would multiply the length by the breadth by the height. . V = length x breadth x height . The volume of a cube (also a rectangular prism) is ‘V = s^3’ where s is one side length. . . Pythag . The hypotenuse is the longest side of a right angled triangle, opposite the right angle. Pythagoras’ theorem dictates that the square of the hypotenuse is the sum of the squares of the other two shorter sides. . Therefore, where a and b is the length of the side of the shorter sides, and c is the hypotenuse: . a² + b² = c² . A Pythagorean triad (also known as a Pythagorean triple) is a set of three integers which satisfy Pythagoras’ theorem. . For example, 3-4-5 is a Pythagorean triad because 3² + 4² = 5², or 9 + 16 = 25. . Surds are numbers that cannot be written as a fraction. Written as a decimal, the decimal numbers repeat, thus, surds are also irrational. Surds contain a √ sign when written in the simplest form. . Pythagoras’ theorem dictates that: . a² + b² = c² therefore √(a² + b²) = c . where the brackets next to the √ sign indicate its constituents are under the square root. . However: . √(a² + b²) ≠ a + b . Using your algebra skills, you can find the length of a shorter side using Pythagoras’ theorem. . For a triangle with sides a and 24, where 25 is the hypotenuse: . a² + b² = c² a² + 24² = 25² a² + 576 = 625 a² = 49 (Subtract 576 from both sides.) ∴ a = √49 = 7 .",

You will want to refer to Year 7 Maths Chapter 4 for basic knowledge of fractions, decimals and percentages. This section is more advanced and omits finance and other basic concepts. . Some brief definition on simple, but essential terminology: . Numerator: the number on top of the fraction bar, being divided by the denominator | Equivalent Fraction: fractions that are equal to each other, more often than not with different numbers in representation | Improper Fraction: a fraction in which the numerator is larger than the denominator | Multiples: a number that may be divided by a certain number without remainder | Reciprocal: the reverse of a fraction, often labelled as “flipping” the number on a fraction, essentially meaning that the numerator and denominator switch places. If number is a mixed numeral, convert to an improper fraction to find the reciprocal | Lowest Common Multiple: the lowest number that can be divided between two specific numbers, often labelled as LCM and used in simplifying fractions | Ascending: an increasing set of numbers | Composite Number: a positive integer which has a divisor that is not 1 or itself | Denominator: the number on the bottom of the fraction bar in a fraction that is dividing the numerator | Proper Fraction: a fraction that is less than 1 with the numerator being less than the denominator | Mixed Numeral: a number that contains a whole number and a fraction | Factors: can be multiplied together to result in a specific number | Highest Common Factor: the largest common factor between 2 numbers | Descending: numbers in a decreasing order | Rational Numbers: a number that can be expressed as a ratio | Irrational Numbers: a number that has no end, such as pi | . Any number being divided by itself, or if a fraction’s numerator and denominator are equal, the number is equal to 1. . To add and subtract fractions, one needs to make the denominators the same. Do this by finding the lowest common multiple of both denominators, and make that the new denominator. Remember that whatever you do to the denominator, you must do to the numerator. . To multiply fractions, simply multiply the numerators to achieve your numerator, and multiply the denominators to find the denominator. A method to make this easier is the “bow tie” method. To do this, look at the numbers that are opposite each other (for the denominator of the first number, the opposite would be the numerator of the next number) and see if you can “cancel” out anything (multiples and variables). Cross these out and/or replace with new numbers respectively, which, in theory, should make the equation easier. . Brendan’s Note: I don’t usually use the bow tie method unless there are variables/pronumerals, but if it’s easier for you, by all means use it. . To divide fractions, simply find the reciprocal and then multiply the fractions. It is very handy to note though, that for smaller fractions like a half, third and quarter, you should be able to easily just double, triple and quadruple your fractions respectively. . Decimals are simply another way to express parts of a whole, and utilise the base 10 metric system. They are less efficient than fractions, but easier to use. . When adding or subtracting decimals, always be wary of where the decimal point is, especially if using an algorithm. .",

    "content": "Year 8 Maths Chapter 5 - Ratios and Rates . Complete . Table of Contents . Ratios Ratios show a relationship between two (or more) related quantities, in the same unit and of the same type. | Distance, Speed and Time | . | . . Ratios . Ratios show a relationship between two (or more) related quantities, in the same unit and of the same type. . For example, a dead rabbit could have a ratio of fur to flesh, of 1:3. The colon (“:”) is used to represent ratios. A written ratio (a : b) is read as a to be or a is to b. . The order of the numbers in a ratio is important. 1:3 is not the same as 3:1. . Equivalent ratios can be formed, for example, by multiplying the ratio by the same amount. What you do to one side you must do to the other. 1:3, 2:6 and 10:30 are equivalent ratios. . Simplifying ratios can be done by dividing the ratio by the same amount, or multiplying if the ratio is not a whole number such as a fraction. You should attempt to express ratios in simplest forms. . Ratios must ALWAYS BE in the same unit. . The unitary method allows ratios to be shared into parts. For example, a ratio of 2:3 can be considered as 2 parts and 3 parts, and to divide a cost, for example, $20, can be divided into all five parts. Therefore, where 1 part is $4, 2 parts is $8 and 3 parts is $12. Hence, the ratio of 2:3 is $8:$12. . A scale drawing is a drawing which is identical to another except for its size. A scale drawing usually has a scale ratio. The scale ratio is written as Drawing (Scale) Length : Actual Length. . For example, a scale ratio of 1:100 is that the actual lengths are 100 times greater than the presented length. . A scale should begin with 1. Hence, the second number can be referred to as the scale factor. . To convert a SCALED distance to an ACTUAL distance you multiply by the scale factor, and vice versa. . Remember! . 1 km = 1000 m (kilo means 1000, however, not necessarily true when it is raised to a power) | 1 m = 100 cm | 1 cm = 10 mm | . Rates compare quantities of different units. All rates must include quantities. . The forward slash (“/”) is used to represent rates. Rates should be written in their simplest form; where the second quantity is only 1 unit (1 km, 1 minute). . The average rate is calculated by: . Dividing the total amount of CHANGE in one quantity by the total amount of change in the second quantity. | What you do to one side you must do to the other. | For example, killing 400 rabbits in 4 days = 100 rabbits in 1 day. | The unitary method is: . Finding the value of 1 unit | Going back up to the required number of units | For example: . The ratio of dead rabbits to mutated pigs is 3:5. If there are 18 dead rabbits, how many mutated pigs are there? . To solve it, you would identify that 3 parts = 18 dead rabbits . Then, divide 18 by 3 to find 1 part . Therefore, 5 parts = 30 mutated pigs. Therefore, there are 30 mutated pigs. . . Distance, Speed and Time . Distance, speed and time are important concepts for real life application of mathematics. . Terms you should know: . Speed is a measure of how fast an object is travelling. | Distance is a measure of how far an object has travelled (in this case). | Time is a measure of how much indefinite continued progress of existence and events in the past, present, and future regarded as a whole has surpassed. Woah. | . You can use two of the measures to find the third one. For example, . Where S is average speed, D is distance travelled and T is time lapsed… . S = D/T . The best way to remember the equations required is to use a DST triangle. . . Where D is the numerator of a fraction in regards to S and T, and D is the product of the equation S x T. . So… . D = S x T S = D/T T = D/S . If the speed of an object does not change over time, then the object is travelling at a constant speed. For example, when a dead rabbit driving a Prius is using cruise control at 80 km/h, then the car has a constant speed of 80 km/h. . Units should also be the same when solving DST equations. . Distance and time graphs are used to show the distance on a vertical axis and the time taken on the horizontal axis, also known as the y and x axis respectively. . Each segment shows whether the object is moving or is stopped. The steepness of any one line segment shows the speed. . Steeper lines = faster speed . Look at this crappy D/T graph (note that D/T stands for distance/time, not design and technology) . .",

You read this as: . Let AB be parallel to XY Therefore, AB is parallel to XY Because, I said so . Or something along those lines (hah, get it?). . If two parallel lines are cut by a transversal… . . … then corresponding and alternate angles are equal, while cointerior angles are equal to 180° (supplementary). . Fun fact! One way to remember Alternate angles is that they make a Z or a S. Salternate, Zalternate. This is sometimes not recommended by maths teachers are they get confusing. . . Polygons . A polygon is a type of shape where the number of interior angles equals the number of sides. Polygons can be convex or non-convex: . Convex polygons all have vertices pointing outside (all exterior angles are reflex angles) | Non-convex polygons have some vertices pointing inwards (at least one exterior angles is not a reflex angle) | . A regular polygon has sides of equal length and equal interior angles. For a list of polygons, see List of n-gon names. . A triangle has: . 3 sides | 3 vertices (usually labelled as A, B, and C) | 1 vertex | 3 interior angles (usually labelled ∠ABC, ∠BAC, ∠ACB) | . Triangles can be classified by interior angles: . Acute-angled triangles are where all angles are acute | Right-angled triangles are where there is one right angle | Obtuse-angled triangles are where there is one obtuse angle | . Triangles can also be classified by their side lengths . Scalene triangles are where all sides are different lengths | Isosceles triangles are when there are two sides that are the same length | Equilateral triangles are when all of the sides are of equal length | . For these triangles, they have unique properties: . Isosceles triangles have the same base angle | Equilateral triangles have angles that are all 60° | . It is important to note that to designate sides as equal you would use a dash, similar to how you would mark parallel lines as we noted earlier. . The angle sum of a triangle is 180°. . Angle sum of n-gon . Dr Nguyen (and Osmond Lin’s dead rabbit) wanted to find the interior angle size of a polygon, but he couldn’t remember its angle sum! Dr Nguyen (and Osmond Lin’s dead rabbit) is confuddled, but by using the below steps, he can find his interior angle size of a polygon! . Let n be the number of sides of said polygon. . 180(n - 2) = angle sum of n-gon . For example: . Where n-gon has 5 sides (pentagon). 180(5 - 2) = angle sum of pentagon = 540° . You can therefore find the size of a single interior angle from this equation . Where the angle sum of n-gon (pentagon) is 540° 540/n = single interior angle of n-gon 540/5 = 108° . Angle sums . The exterior angle theorem dictates that the exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of the two opposite interior angles. . For example: . . The angle sum of a triangle can be used to prove other theorems, for example, one which relates to the angle in a semicircle. Although this isn’t apart of the main textbook curriculum, it is located in the Enrichment section of the textbook. . Suppose a triangle, △ABC, where BC is equal to the diameter of the semicircle, then ∠C is equal to 90°. . As you may recall from Chapter 3, quadrilaterals are four-sided polygons. They include kites, trapeziums (also known as trapezoids in North America), parallelograms, rhombus, rectangles, and squares. . Every quadrilateral have two diagonals, and in some quadrilaterals the diagonals bisect each other (cut each other in half). . Quadrilaterals can be convex or non-convex. . Convex quadrilaterals all have vertices pointing outside (all exterior angles are reflex angles) | Non-convex quadrilaterals have some vertices pointing inwards (one exterior angles is not a reflex angle) | . The angle sum of a quadrilateral is 360°. . Quadrilaterals with parallel sides contain two pairs of co-interior angles. . In line and rotational symmetry, the line of symmetry divides a shape into equal parts (mirrored). . The order of rotational symmetry refers to the number of times a figure “coincides with its original position” in turning through one full rotation, according to the textbook. . A better way to put this: . In one full rotation (360° rotation) how many times does the position of the figure match the original position? . For an equilateral triangle, it is the same at the beginning of the rotation, a third of the way through, and another third of the way through, before it returns. If a figure has no rotational symmetry, its order of rotational symmetry is 1. . A polyhedron has the following properties:: . closed solid | flat surfaces | vertices and edges | named after the number of faces | . Euler’s formula dictates: . E = F + V - 2 . Where F = faces, V = vertices and E = edges. . Prisms are polyhedra. They have the following properties: . two identical/congruent ends, + an identical cross section to the ends | other faces are parallelograms | right prisms have all other faces as rectangles | named after number of parallelograms that make up the solid | . Pyramids are polyhedra with a base face, and all other faces meeting at a vertex point; the apex. They are named by the shape of the base. . Solids with curved surfaces include cylinders, spheres and cones. . Cubes (hexahedron) have 6 square, congruent faces. Rectangular prisms are also known as cuboids. Thanks America™. .

This section is more advanced. For quadratics take a look at Year 9 Maths Chapter 8 and Year 9 Maths Chapter 10 . Basic terms and information: . A number plane (or Cartesian plane) includes a y-axis and an x-axis, intersecting at right angles, forming four quadrants. | Anti-clockwise from top-right: Quadrant 1 - Quadrant 4. | Point on a number plane has coordinates: (x, y), where x is number of horizontal units from origin (x-coordinate) and vice versa (vertical units, y-coordinate). | The point (0, 0) is known as the origin. | A rule or a formula is an equation connecting two or more variables. | A straight line forms a linear rule. | Linear rules are often written with y as the subject. For example, y = 3x - 2 | . You can use a table of values to find a rule. The rule must be true for every pair of coordinates, substituted into a table or graph. . For example: . y = ☐x + ☐ . To find a rule, use the formula below. . y = mx + b . where m is the gradient and b is the y-intercept. This is known as gradient-intercept form. . The gradient is rise over run. | On a graph, it is the steepness of a line, measured by a specific height measurement, over a specific length measurement. | For example, for a gradient to be 2, on a graph the line would be increasing in height, and for every 5 units on the x axis, there would be a growth of 10 units. | In a table of values, it is the difference in the y-axis between every consecutive number on the x-axis | The y-intercept is the constant value when x = 0. | The x-intercept is the constant value where y = 0. | . . A linear equation has a solution, where a pair of values, representing x-coordinates and y-coordinates, solve an equation when substituted into their relative pronumerals. . Where there are two straight lines crossing over, there is a point of intersection (the point where the lines cross). In this case, the point of intersection is the pair of values that satisfies both rules. . . Non-linear relationships are graphs or rules that are not linear (form a curve, such as a parabola). . An example of a non-linear curve: . y = x^2 .",

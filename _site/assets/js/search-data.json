    "content": "“Haven’t we all done this in our Maths Summary Books?” . This website contains archives of Adrian’s digitised exam resources and stuff like that. Feel free to use it for your own intents and purposes. . . Historically stuff like this got hosted on Google Drive but 99 page Google Docs can get laggy very quickly. As I’m usually the only person working on my own resources, I didn’t need the system that could support editing as well, so we’re now hosting it on this nice website. . I’ve got more of where this stuff came from over on Quizlet so take a look there if there’s things missing from here, and if you’re doing the Maths 5.2 curriculum and you’d like to see what the 5.3 bois are up to, check out this Google Drive folder. That Google Drive link also contains the link to the spiritual precursor of this project, Maths and Science Study Notes. . What do you have here? . We’ve got a few things on this website including: . Study notes | Cheat sheets | Practice papers | Student-made Quizzes | . and other things that might be of interest to you. . How much have you already completed? . You can see our Roadmap which contains our schedule and projected topics. . How can I download this offline? . Please see Offline Copies for more information. . Is there more? . If you’d like to contribute, please feel free to email me and let me know what you can help out with. . Last updated: 29 September 2019 AEST .",

    "content": "Roadmap . for Things You Should Know and Adrian’s Study Club . A majority of the project will be moving everything from Google Docs to Markdown format to host on this site. However, with finals approaching close and our lack of neccessity for learning about Roman numerals, migration to the new platform will be done from topics of most importance to topics of least importance. This also means that topic areas from previous years that don’t get covered now won’t be prioritised as much. . The roadmap allows us to keep track of what needs to be completed, what has already been completed and what is most important for completion. You can view each subject’s roadmap on it’s parent page. For example, for the Maths roadmap, you would click on the Maths parent page. . If you’d like to contribute and help out, please email me! If your school works from a different curriculum let me know too and we can make an arrangement to mutually benefit both schools! . Last updated: 29 September 2019 .",

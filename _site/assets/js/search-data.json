Hey there! Please be advised if you’re an Aloys boi this doesn’t exactly match your textbook! I’ve tried to keep similar concepts together so if you can’t find something, feel free to use the textbook, or use that neat little search bar up the top there! Thanks! . . Model of an atom . Model of an atom: . Small and dense nucleus made up of: neutrons (uncharged particles) | protons (positively charged particles) | | Surrounded by rapidly moving electrons | Held together through nuclear forces | Particles with the same charge repel each other. Particles with opposite charges are attracted to each other. . Most volume of the electron is made up of empty space. . Electrons == 1/2000th size of protons and neutrons. | Electrons have electrical charge of -1 | Protons have electrical charge of +1 | Neutrons have no electrical charge | Atoms usually have the same number of electrons as neutrons | Electrons move rapidly around the nucleus, in regions known as electron shells . | In the nucleus: protons and neutrons | Surrounding the nucleus: electrons | . The number of protons in an atom determines what type of atom it is . e.g gold atom has 79 protons . . Electrons . and the 2, 8, 18 rule . Electrons fill electron shells. The number of electrons a shell can fit increases as the shell’s distance from the nucleus increases. The outermost shell is called the valence shell. . The numnber of electrons a shell can hold is equal to 2n^2 where n is the shell number. . Therefore: . 2 × 1^2 = 2 (for shell one) 2 × 2^2 = 8 (for shell two) 2 × 3^2 = 18 (for shell three) . and so on. This is called the 2, 8, 18 rule. Electrons fill from the inner most shell going outwards. You can see a diagramatic representation on this electron dot diagram. . The 2, 8, 18 rule has some caveats though. See Shells! for more information. . . Examples of electron configurations . Aluminium has 13 protons, therefore aluminium’s electron configuration is 2, 8, 3 . Sodium has 11 protons, therefore sodium’s electron configuration is 2, 8, 1 . Oxygen has 8 protons, therefore sodium’s electron configuration is 2, 6 . Excited atoms . When an atom is excited it may “jump” to a higher electron shell. They drop back down and release light energy. . Groups in the Periodic Table . There are 18 groups in the periodic table. Here are some important ones. . Group Name Other     . Group 1 | Alkali metals | React strongly with water to form basic solutions |   |   | . Group 2 | Alkaline earth metals | Highly reactive |   |   | . Group 17 | Halogens | Non-metal elements |   |   | . Group 18 | Noble gases | Inert elements that aren’t that reactive |   |   | . Group 3-12 | Transition metals | Metallic elements |   |   | . . Atomic numbers and mass numbers . Atomic number . We know that the number of protons an atom has dictates what atom it is. In the periodic table, this is known as the atomic number. . Number of protons == Number of electrons == Atomic number e.g Chlorine has 17 protons therefore it&#39;s atomic number is 17 . Atoms are electrically neutral and must have the same number of electrons as protons. Otherwise, they become ions. . Mass number . Mass number == number of protons + number of neutrons . Electrons are too small to be counted. . Subatomic particles . You can represent the mass number and atomic number of an element like this: . . where: . A is the atomic number | Z is the mass number, and | E is the element symbol. | . For example, for the element iron, . . You can use this information to calculate the number of neutrons… number of neutrons = A − Z = 56 − 26 = 30 . … and the number of electrons or the number of protons. number of electrons = number of protons = Z = 26 . . The Periodic Table . Metalloids are elements that have properties of both metals and non-metals. On the periodic table they sort of zig zag. There are more cool patterns too… . Characteristic Pattern down a group Pattern across a period . Atomic number and mass number | Increases | Increases | . Atomic radius | Increases | Decreases | . Melting points | Decreases for groups 1 to 5 and increases for groups 5 to 8 | Generally increases then decreases | . Reactivity | Metals become more reactive and non-metals become less reactive | Is high, then decreases and then increases. Group 8 elements are inert and do not react. | . Metallic character | Increases | Decreases | . Shells! . The largest atoms have up to seven electron shells, therefore, there are seven periods. | The period tells you the number of electron shells. | The third shell can hold up to 18 electrons but any shell with more than 8 electrons become unstable. Therefore, after 8 electrons the fourth shell starts to fill. | From scandium to zinc (21 - 30) which are transition metals, the third shell fills, and then the fourth shell continues to fill up. | . Valencies . You need to know your valencies in the periodic table. You can write valencies above the group on your periodic table, or refer to this table. . Group Valency . Group 1 | 1 | . Group 2 | 2 | . Group 3 | 3 | . Group 4, group 14 | 4 | . Group 15 | 3 | . Group 16 | 2 | . Group 17 | 1 | . This will be really helpful for naming chemical formulas of ionic and covalent compounds later on. . . Ions . Ions are atoms that have gained or lost electrons. It means they have an electric charge. Positive ions have more protons than electrons, and vice versa. When the outer shell is filled atoms tend to be more stable (which is why it’s cool to be noble – elements with full valence electrons). . For example, a sodium atom might need to lose an electron to have a full valence shell, and a chloride atom might need to gain an electron to have a full valence shell. The sodium atom can lose an electron to the chloride atom and now both atoms have full valence shells. . Naming ions . Positive ions are called cations, while negative ions are called anions. Cations keep their original name (e.g boron, lithium, etc) while negative ions have the -ide suffix (e.g flouride, nitride, etc). . Common ions . Atom name Ion name Chemical symbol Atom name Ion name Chemical symbol . lithium | lithium | Li+ | iodine | iodide | I− | . sodium | sodium | Na+ | fluorine | fluoride | F− | . potassium | potassium | K+ | chlorine | chloride | Cl− | . calcium | calcium | Ca2+ | oxygen | oxide | O2− | . aluminium | aluminium | Al3+ | nitrogen | nitride | N3− | . Ionic compounds . The outer electrons of atoms interact with other electrons, and the become chemically joined to form molecules. | This is known as a chemical bond. | Molecules between atoms of different elements become a compound. | Noble gases with stable electron configurations and full valence shells don’t react to form compounds. | Compounds where atoms lose and gain electrons are called ionic compounds. | Sodium chloride, copper sulfate and calcium carbonate are examples of ionic compounds. | Ionic compounds occur where metal and non-metal atoms combine. This creates an ionic bond.ionic | . . Ionic compounds usually: . are made up of positive and negative ions | are solids at room temperature | dave high melting points | dissolve in water | when dissolved to become an aqueous solution, this soltuion is usually conductive to electricity | Naming an ionic compound1 . You can solve for a metal and a non-metal’s ionic compound chemical formula using the cross method. . REMEMBER: Cations first! . Explanation2 . Find the chemical formula for iron(III) bromide. . NB: Note that electrovalency, valency, and charges are sometimes interchangably. They are similar but not the same. NOTICE that iron is a metal and bromide is a non-metal. . To determine the formula of an ionic compound, you need to balance the charges (electrovalencies). Compounds have to be electrically neutral. To do this: . Find electrovalencies of the ions in the compound. For example: Iron has a charge of +3 Bromide has a charge of -1 | Figure out how many negative ions you need to balance out positive ions, and vice versa. To balance out iron&#39;s charge of +3, you need 3 bromide ions. Therefore, 1x iron ion charge of single iron(III) ion == +3 total charge of 1x iron ion == +3 3x bromide ion charge of single bromide ion == -1 total charge of 3x bromide ion == -3 ∴ iron total charge of +3 balances with bromide total charge of -3 . | Write the formula. One iron ion, three bromide ions ∴ FeBr₃ is the chemical formula for iron(III) bromide | Crossover method . An easy method to determine ionic compound formulae. . Take a metal and a non-metal. For this example, we will use magnesium and chloride. | Write their corresponding valencies without + or - under them. For example, magnesium’s valency is +2 and chloride’s valency is -1. | “Cross over” these valencies. Therefore, we end in MgCl2. Mg Cl +2 -1 2 1 # cross over MgCl2 . | Remember, the elements need to achieve electrical neutrality. How many Cl ions do you need to neutralise Mg? . Monoatomic ions such as aluminium ion, oxide ion and sodium ion contain one symbol. If you receive a radical or a group of atoms with one singular charge it is known as a polyatomic ion. These include nitrate (NO₃ - overall charge 1-), sulfate (SO₄ - overall charge 2-) and phosphate (PO₄ - overall charge 3-) . QUICK NOTE: Radicals are groups of atoms with an overall charge. . See the example below for a demonstration on hwo to deal with polyatomic ions. . Examples . . Covalent compounds . Atoms can share electrons to create a covalent bond. Covalent molecules can be between more than one type of atom or atoms of the same element. For example, oxygen gas (O2) is made up of two oxygen atoms sharing electrons. . Elements combine and share electrons to achieve full electron shells. Here are some common covalent molecules. . . Covalent compounds usually: . are gases, liquids, or solids with low melting points | aren’t electrically conductive | insolube in water | Naming a covalent compound . . Balancing chemical equations . See more at In a Nutshell: Equations . While it may be easy to write word equations like . Magnesium metal + hydrochloric acid –&gt; hydrogen gas + magnesium chloride . writing chemical equations are a bit different. . Here, have an easy one. . H₂ + O₂ –&gt; H₂O . The reactant side (H₂ + O₂) has one more oxygen atom than the product side (H₂O). Therefore, we need to multiply the atoms to balance the equation. . We do that by writing a number in front of a formula, which multiplies ALL of the atoms in that formula by that number. For example, if we write 2 in front of the hydrogen gas on the reactant side and water on the product side… . 2H₂ + O₂ –&gt; 2H₂O . Suddenly we have balanced the equations. Now, there are 4 hydrogen and 2 oxygen on each side. . Here are some more fun ones to do. Use the table for common ionic and covalent compounds. Answers are below. . Activity .

Acids and Bases on BBC Bitesize (National 5) . basically the better version of this . . Common properties . Acids . Acids are corrosive. They taste sour, and can be used to react with other substances. . Acids are chemicals with a pH &lt; 7. Acids contain hydrogen ions (H⁺). When acids are diluted with water the concentration of H⁺ ions in the solution is reduced, and it’s pH increases towards 7 (neutral pH). . Bases1 . Bases are sometimes corrosive. They are bitter, slippery, and/or soapy. Bases that can be dissolved in water are called alkalis. . Bases are chemicals with a ph &gt; 7. Bases contain hydroxide ions (OH⁻). When bases are diluted with water the concentration of OH⁻ ions in the solutions is reduced, and it’s pH decreases towards 7 (neutral pH). . Acids have a pH less than 7. Bases have a pH greater than 7. Remember it as a comes before b. Acids come before bases on the pH scale. . Table of Acids and Bases you should know . Test yourself on Quizlet . Acid name Formula Ionic Formula PH Level . Hydrochloric acid | HCl | H⁺(aq) Cl⁻(aq) | 2 | . Sulfuric acid | H₂SO₄ | 2H⁺(aq) SO₄²⁻(aq) | 2 | . Nitric acid | HNO₃ | H⁺(aq) NO₃⁻(aq) | 2 | .

Potassium hydroxide | KOH | K⁺(aq) OH⁻(aq) | 13 | . . Water and neutral solutions has a pH level of 7. . . Differentiate between strong and weak . You can test for how acidic or basic is using a number of ways. This includes using universal indicator to estimate pH, or test the reactivity of solutions in water. . Neutralisation Reactions . Test yourself on Quizlet . When you mix an acid and a base together, a chemical reaction occurs! The mixture will get warmer and it usually follows this formula: . acid + base –&gt; salt + water . Metal oxides and metal hydroxides . Both metal oxides and metal hydroxides are bases . metal oxide + acid –&gt; salt + water metal hydroxide + acid –&gt; salt + water . Metal carbonates . When metal carbonates react with acids, they work the same way as metal oxides and hydroxides but on the reactant side there is also carbon dioxide gas . metal carbonate + acid –&gt; salt + water + carbon dioxide . Example . copper oxide + hydrochloric acid –&gt; copper chloride + water CuO + 2HCl –&gt; CuCl₂ + H₂O . Note how chloride in copper chloride on the reactant side has a subscript 2. This is to balance the chemical equation. As copper(II) has a valency of 2 we use the crossover method as covered in Chemistry 1 and multiplechloride by two. To balance the equation on both sides we add a 2 in front of HCl which makes sure there are equal atoms on both the reactant and product side. . copper carbonate + nitric acid –&gt; copper nitrate + water + carbon dioxide CuCO₃ + 2HNO₃ –&gt; Cu(NO₃)₂ + H₂O + CO₂ . What happens when acids react with… . Acids react with bases . When acids and bases react, they neutralise and produce salt and water. . Acids react with metals . When acids and metals react, they produce salt and hydrogen gas. . Acids react with carbonates . When acids and carbonates react, they produce salt, water and carbon dioxide. . . Extra information . Reactivity: tendency to lose or gain electrons . Reactivity of metal DECREASES from left to right, and INCREASES from up to down. Alkali metals in Group 1 have the highest reactivity, while noble gases in Group 8 are typically unreactive. . . Footnotes and Other Notes .

    "content": "The 7 Geographical Concepts . Complete . Table of Contents . The 7 Geographical Concepts Place | Space | Environment | Interconnection | Scale | Sustainability | Change | Footnotes and Other Notes | . | . Geographical Concepts on NESA . . There are 7 geographical concepts as defined by the K-10 Geographical Concepts Continuum. Based off Geographical Concepts on NESA K-10 Key Learning Areas. . Adrian has rewritten it for you here. Even though you can go on the website. But Adrian needs to actually read it himself so that’s why he is typing it all over again. . Place . THE CONCEPT OF PLACE IS ABOUT THE SIGNIFICANCE OF PLACES AND WHAT THEY ARE LIKE . Places can be parts of the Earth’s surface with different identities | They can be described by location, shape, boundaries, features, environmental, and human characteristics | Place is influenced by environmental characteristics and resources, relative location, interconnections, culture, economy, and decisions and actions made regarding place over time | Characteristics of place can be tangible… landforms | people | . | or intangible scenic quality | culture | . | Environmental characteristics of place are influenced by human and environmental processes | Sustainability of places can be threatened by… natural hazards; | climate change; | economic, social and technological change; | government decisions and politics; and | resource exhaution. | . | . Space . THE CONCEPT OF SPACE IS ABOUT THE SIGNIFICANCE OF LOCATION AND SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION, AND WAYS PEOPLE ORGANISE AND MANAGE THE SPACES THAT WE LIVE IN . Environmental and human characetristics of places can be influenced by their location | The effects of location and distance can be reduced (potentially unequally) through transport and communication technologies | Individual characteristics of places form spatial distributions | Distributions can have environmental, economic, social and political consequences | Spaces can be perceived; | structured; | organised; and | managed by people | . | They can be modified to achieve or fit a particular purpose(s) | . Environment . THE CONCEPT OF ENVIRONMENT IS ABOUT THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE ENVIRONMENT IN HUMAN LIFE, AND THE IMPORTANT INTERRELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN HUMANS AND THE ENVIORNMENT . The environment is the product of: geological (relating to the earth’s physical structure); | atmospheric (rtt. atmosphere of the earth); | hydrological (rtt. properties, distribution and circulation of water); | geomorphic (rtt. form of the landscape and other natural features of the earth); | edaphic (rtt. soil); | biotic (living/biological) and abiotic (physical); and | human processes. | . | The environment supports and enriches life by: providing raw materials and food; | absorbing and recycling wastes; | maintaining a safe habitat; and | being a source of enjoyment and inspiration | . | Concepts that influence how people perceive, adapt to and use environments Culture | Population density | Economy | Technology | Values | Environmental worldviews | . | Human-induced environmental change (and management, thereof), including cause and effect, consequences of change, and application of geographical concepts and techniques in order to identify appropriate strategies | The impacts of specific hazards in different environments can be determined by natural and human factors | Hazards can be managed through prevention, mitigation, and preparedness | . Interconnection . THE CONCEPT OF INTERCONNECTION EMPHASISES THAT NO OBJECT OF GEOGRAPHICAL STUDY CAN BE VIEWED IN ISOLATION . People and organisations in places are interconnected with other places | Interconnections have significant influences on place characteristics and the changes that occur in these places | Environmental and human processes (e.g water cycle, urbanisation) are sets of cause and effect interconnections | These operate between and within places | They can be organised as networks of interconnections through flow of matter | energy | information | actions | . | . Scale . THE CONCEPT OF SCALE IS ABOUT THE WAY THAT GEOGRAPHICAL PHENOMENA AND PROBLEMS CAN BE EXAMINED AT DIFFERENT SPATIAL LEVELS. . Generalisations (general statement about something) and relationships (way which two or more things are connected) at one level of scale can be different at higher or lower levels For example, in regards to studies of vegitation, at the global scale climate is the main concern, but at the local scale, soil, drainage, public policy and irrigation may be the larger factor | . | Cause and effect relationships can cross scales For example, local events can have global outcomes, such as the burning of the Amazon rainforest, and how that impacts the rest of the world’s air quality | . | . Sustainability . THE CONCEPT OF SUSTAINABILITY IS ABOUT THE CAPACITY OF THE ENVIRONMENT TO CONTINUE TO SUPPORT OUR LIVES AND THE LIVES OF OTHER LIVING CREATURES INTO THE FUTURE. . Sustainability: a goal, and a way of thinking (on how to progress towards that goal) uwa so philosophical! | Progress towards sustainability depends on maintenance or restoration of our environment, including functions that sustain life and human wellbeing (economic and social) | Understanding of the causes of unsustainability requires a study of environmental process causing degration of an environmental function (cause and effect); | human actions that have caused these processes (cause and effect); and | attitudinal, demographic, social, economic and political causes of human actions. | . | There are a variety of contested views on how progress towards sustainability should be achieved, often informed by worldviews or similar case studies outside of NSW and Australia | . Change . THE CONCEPT OF CHANGE IS ABOUT EXPLAINING GEOGRAPHICAL PHENOMENA BY INVESTIGATING HOW THEY HAVE DEVELOPED OVER TIME . Envrionmental change can occur over both short term and long term timeframes | Environmental, economic, social, and technological change is spatially uneven and affects places differently | Current processes of change can be used to predict future trends and this information can be used to identify what would be needed to achieve preferred and more desirable futures | .

This section contains limited information, and is based off the Y9 Aloys Final exam for 2019. . . The Nervous System . The nervous system controls and coordinates your body. It is divided into two parts: . Central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) | Peripheral nervous system (nerves that connect the CNS to the rest of the body) | . Either electrical or chemical nerve impulses can occur. . Stimulus, Receptor, Response! . The first step to initiating a response is having a stimulus. . A stimulus can be anything which triggers an action, including: . Seeing a chainsaw thrown at you by Oscar | Hearing the teacher coming towards you while you’re playing video games in class | Seeing a freezer full of chocolate | . This stimulus is received by a receptors. Examples of receptors include: Type of receptor|Stimulus these receptors respond to|Example of places where these are found :—–:|:—–:|:—–: Chemoreceptors|Chemicals|Tongue Photoreceptors|Light|Eye Mechanoreceptors|Pressure or distortion|Skin, inner ear Thermoreceptors|Heat|Skin . Different types of receptor cells do different things. . The Structure of the Neuron . A neuron is a long cell containing: . a cell body and a nucleus which supplies energy and nutrients to the neuron | dendrites which are branches that receive nerve impulses from receptors and other receptors | axons which are long structures that nerve impulses pass along. Electrical signals travelling along are insulated by myelin | axon branches at the end of each axon that send nerve impulses to other neurons or effectors | . Direction of travel: . Dendrite ––––––––––––––––&gt; Axon Branch . . The three types of neurons . Sensory neurons: stimulus to CNS | Interneurons: CNS | Motor neurons: CNS to effectors (e.g muscles, glands) | . Sensory neurons are pseudounipolar (axon with two extensions – one to receive info and other to transmit to spinal cord). . Interneurons and motor neurons are multipolar (one axon and many dendrites) so that lots of information can flow through. . Other neuron structures not mentioned in the above 3 neurons include unipolar and bipolar neurons. . . Neurotransmitters and Synapses . The synapse on Khan Academy . . To continue relaying a nerve impulse across different neurons, chemical compounds called neurotransmitters are used. . The gap between neurons are called synapses. . When a nerve impulse reaches the axon (presynaptic) terminal, then neurotransmitters are released into the synapse. This is because a nerve impulse activates voltage gates which lets Ca²⁺ from outside the neuron rushes inside to the neuron (where the Ca²⁺ concentration is fewer.) . Then, this triggers synaptic vesicles (which store neurotransmitters) release transmitters. At the dendrite of the postsynaptic cell the neurotransmitters bind to receptor proteins. This in turn will open or close ion channels (either causing it to become overall more negative (depolarising) or positive (hyperpolarising)). . Did you get that? . In a nutshell: . Gaps between neurons are synapses | Nerve impulse reaches presynaptic axon terminal and neurotransmitters are released | Postsynaptic dendrite receives neuron, causing cell to fire and relay the nerve impulse | Reflex arc . When reflex acions occur, no conscious thought is required. Reflex arcs are actions that are carried out quickly. . . . The Structure of the Brain . Protected within a skull | Covered with meninges; three layers of protective tissue that surrounds the brain and spinal cord | Covered with cerebral fluid; fluid surrounding the brain under the meninges | . The brain consists of three main sections: . Cerebrum: largest part of the brain (90%) and made up of two hemispheres that control memory, speech, thought. Conscious thought! | Cerebellum: between the cerebrum and brainstem and controls balance and muscle | Brain stem (medulla): connected to spinal cord and controls breathing, heartbeat, digestion | . . Stem cells . Stem cells are cells that can develop into other specialised cells. They can be used in some cases to regrow damaged nerve cells. . . The Structure of the Eye . This section is basically ripped off the textbook. Redundant . The eye is made up of a number of different components. . . The cornea is the clear, curved, outer surface of the eye It is curved so light approaching the eye is refracted towards the pupil | . | The lens is a clear, flexible tissue located behind the iris and the pupil It focuses light onto the retina | . | The retina is a curved surface at the very back of the eye, which is lined with photoreceptors. The photoreceptors respond to light by sending signals to the optic nerve, which in turn sends signals to the brain in the CNS . | Short sightedness and long-sightedness occurs when light doesn’t focus on the retina properly | . . Endocrine system . Human endocrine system on BBC Bitesize . Hormones are produced by glands in the endocrine system, and carried in the bloodstream. Hormones alter activity of target organs (organs with receptor molecules on cell surfaces that recognise a specific hormone). They differ from the nervous system as effects are slower but longer lasting. . For example, adrenaline produced in the adrenal glands target several organs in the respiratory and circulatory system. This is the ‘fight or flight’ reflex that can increase breathing and heart rate, and convert glycogen to glucose. . When conditions are constant and carefully controlled, we call this homeostasis. For example body temperature, blood glucose levels and pH levels remain relatively stable. . Insulin . Insulin is produced in the pancreas. Insulin is then carried through the bloodstream to the liver to regulate glucose levels in the blood. This then causes conversion of glucose into glycogen (for storage). Remember that glucose = sugar. . Thyroid . The thyroid gland produces thyroxine which regulates metabolism, heartbeat and body temperature. If there is too much thyroxine then body temperature rises. . Negative Feedback Loop . A negative feedback loop is a mechanism to lower raised levels of something, and then to raise reduced levels of something, continuously. . Negative feedback is when a change in the body is detected, a message is sent to a gland or organ, and a response is initiated. . Positive feedback, however, is when a change in the normal state is amplified. For example, when the brain is stimulated to create more oxytocin (for example during labour), it induces contractions which in turn release postaglandins. And then, more oxytocin is released. Stretch receptors no longer fire once the baby is out of the womb, and no more oxytocin levels are produced. . . Caffiene Negative Feedback Loop . . Blood Glucose Negative Feedback Loop . . Body Temperature Negative Feedback Loop . . A Air temperature increases. | B Heat receptors detect increase in temperature and send message to the hypothalamus in the brain. Message travels along nerve cells. | C Hypothalamus sends messages to sweat glands and walls of capillaries close to the skin. | D Capillaries close to the skin dilate and heat radiates from the skin surface. | E Sweat production increases. Heat is lost as sweat evaporates from the skin. | F Temperature returns to normal. Messages from hypothalamus cease and cooling responses are turned off. | G Air temperature decreases. | H Heat receptors detect decrease in temperature and send message to the hypothalamus in the brain. Message travels along nerve cells. | I Hypothalamus sends messages to muscles and walls of capillaries close to the skin. | J Capillaries close to skin contract. Less heat radiates from skin. | K Muscles shiver, generating heat. | L Temperature returns to normal. Messages from hypothalamus cease and warming responses are turned off. | . Where are the glands in the Endocrine system located? . The endocrine system consists of a number of different glands. . . Reproduction . Hormones control the menstrual cycle in women and sperm production in men. The hormone oestrogen and progesterone are associated with menstruation. . During menstruation, oestrogen and progesterone levels are low. | Before childbirth, progesterone levels are low. | After menstruation, oestrogen levels rise. | After ovulation, progesterone levels rise. | During puberty, increased levels of oestrogen in women and testosterone in men cause secondary sex characteristics such as changed body structure, growth spurts, and more hair. Ew. | . Love is in the air . Redundant . In animal species, pheromones are released when they are ready for mating. This releases a distinctive smell in the air. | . | Oxytocin is released when you cuddle people. It helps humans develop bonds with each other. | . | . . Compare and Contrast: The endocrine system and the nervous system . . . The endocrine system uses chemicals to affect changes in the body | It makes slower but longer lasting changes to target organs | The nervous system uses electrical signals (and sometimes chemical signals) to affect changes in the body | Changes are more immediate but are shorter lasting | The nervous system is codependent with the endocrine system Reproductive hormones can affect the development of the nervous system | The hypothalamus at the base of the brain controls the pituitary gland, which controls most other glands | . | .",

Communicable Diseases on BBC Bitesize (AQA GCSE) . basically the better version of this . . Diseases . Disease can be sorted into two categories: . Infectious - caused by pathogens (e.g bacteria, viruses, fungi) and are contagious | Non-infectious - no pathogens and non-contagious | . . Infectious diseases . Pathogens are parasites that live in or on other organisms (the host) and have a harmful effect on their host. What bad guests! They can either me microscopic (invisible to the naked eye) or macroscopic (visible to the naked eye). Meet the pAtHoGeNs! . Type of pathogen Description Typical size Example of disease . Bacteria | Single celled organisms with DNA outside of the nucleus | 0.2-5μm | Leprosy, throat infections, scarlet fever, HIV | . Viruses | DNA or RNA wrapped in protein, requires a host to reproduce | 20-300nm | AIDS, influenza, hepatitis, measles, salmonella | . Protozoa | Single celled organisms with DNA inside the nucleus | 2-200μm | Malaria, cryptospordium | . Fungi | One or more cells with cell walls and a nucleus, but no chloroplast | 50μm –&gt; much larger | Ringworm, athlete’s foot | . Transmission can occur through direct contact, water, air, food, or other organisms (vectors). The table from BBC Bitesize below outlines some examples. . Type Examples . Direct contact | This can be sexual contact during intercourse or non-sexual contact, like shaking hands. | . Water | Dirty water can transmit many diseases, such as the cholera bacterium. | . Air | When a person who is infected by the common cold sneezes, they can spray thousands of tiny droplets containing virus particles to infect others. | . Unhygienic food preparation | Undercooked or reheated food can cause bacterial diseases like Escherichia coli which is a cause of food poisoning. | . Vector | Any organism that can spread a disease is called a vector. Many farmers think tuberculosis in their cattle can be spread by badgers. | . There are also macroparasites and prions but this isn’t important for now. . Non-infectious diseases . Type of disease Description . Nutrition | Overeating, undereating, unbalanced diet | . Ageing | Gradual breakdown of body tissues | . Cancer | Multiplication of body cells at an abnormal rate | . Inherited disorders | Passed on from family genes | . Mental disorders | Caused by chemical deficiencies, strees, trauma | . Metabolic disorders | Caused by chemical deficiencies | . Environmental disorders | Exposure to poisons, asbestos, fire, drugs, pollution | . Most people die from lifestyle diseases such as cardiovascular diseases (stroke, heart attack) which is caused by obesity and lack of nutritione/exercise or lung cancer as a result of smoking. . . Lines of Defence . Your body has many defences against pathogens. They can be either specific/non-specific. Specific defences involve targeted and tailored immunity of invading pathogens, while non-specific defences are applied to all threats equally. . First line of defence – Non-specific . The first line of defence are physical and chemical barriers that try to prevent entry of invading pathogens. . Physical barriers include: . skin | coughing | sneezing | hairs and eyelashes | cilia | . Chemical barriers include: . saliva | tears | stomach acid | mucus | . Second line of defence – Non-specific . If a pathogen evades the first line of defence, the second line of defence kicks in. At this point, an infection has occured. . Affected area becomes swollen and inflamed, while body temperature increases | More blood is directed to the area and blood vessels become permeable (porous - more leaky) | White blood cells including phagocytes move to the infected area | Phagocytes engulf and destroy pathogens | . Third line of defence – Specific . If a pathogen evades the first and second lines of defence, then the third line of defence kicks in. It is specific immunity; which is targeted and tailored towards the type of pathogen. Any foreign particle that stimulates the production of antibodies (usually through an immune response) is an antigen. . Antigen enters body and lymphocytes (white blood cells) begin to divide. They split into specialised B lymphocytes and T lymphocytes (B cells and T cells respectively) | B cells produce plasma cells which produce antibodies that bind with particular antigens. The first time the body is exposed to a specific type of antigen is a trial and error phase which takes 10-17 for the right antibodies to be produced | T cells assist B cells to create an antibody and they do different jobs (e.g attack pathogens, attract/activate phagocytes, assist B cells with antibody production, etc) | .",

How do environments function? | How do people’s worldviews affect their attitudes to and use of environments? | What are the causes and consequences of change in environments and how can this change be managed? | Why is an understanding of environmental processes and interconnections essential for sustainable management of environments? | . Outcomes and key inquiry questions are from our friends at NESA. . . Environment . Environment: an interrelationship between living (biotic) and non-living (abiotic) | Ecosystem: living organisms within a community and abiotic components of their environment | . Food chain . Food chains and food webs consist of: . Producers: convert sunlight into food (photosynthesis) – plants | Consumers: eat other annimals or plants – animals | . Scale in the environment . Revise on scale on The 7 Geographical Concepts. . Individual organism | Population – groups of plants or animals of the same species in one particular area | Community - populations of different species interact with each other | Ecosystem - interaction between communinty and its abiotic habitat | Biome - defined by similar landscapes (climate, vegetation) | Habitats are preferred locations of organisms because it has the resources the organism needs to survive and thrive, such as water, temperature, minerals, sunlight, and other features. . Australia’s biomes . . A vast majority of Australia is desert. Southeastern Australia (Tasmania, coastal Victoria, coastal NSW, Adelaide) is temperate and northern Australia is tropical/subtropical. Quensland tends to be less tropical than more northern parts such as Cape York and Darwin. . . Environmental Processes . this will be fun . Water cycle . Evaporation –&gt; condensation –&gt; precipitation –&gt; collection . Carbon cycle . Carbon Cycle on Earth Observatory . There are two carbon cycles: long term (geological) and short term (biological/physical). . Geological - long term . Occurs over hundreds of millions of years | Buildup of carbon in rocks/fossil fuels | Moves between rocks, soil, ocean and atmosphere using chemical reactions and tectonic activity | . 1. Atmosphereic carbon + water –&gt; carbonic acid 2. Atmosphere (carbonic acid in rain) –&gt; Lithosphere (acid dissolves rocks) 3. Calcium, magnesium, potassium, or sodium ions released 4. Rvier carries ions to ocean . Biological/Physical - short term . Occurs over days/weeks/months/years | Cycling of carbon through photosynthesis and cellular metabolism | . Carbon flows between atmosphere, land and atmopshere. . . 1. Carbon dioxide + water + energy –&gt; sugar + oxygen (plants/phytoplanton photosynthesis) 2. Either a) Plants break down sugars for energy b) Animals eat plants/phytoplankton and break down sugars for energy c) Plants/plankton die d) Fire consumes plants *RIP* 3. Sugar + oxygen –&gt; water + carbon dioxide + energy 4. Carbon ends up in the atmosphere again . In winter when less plants are growing and more plants are dying then carbon dioxide concentrations increase. . . Monthly Change in Carbon Dioxide (Northern Hemi) 1959-2010 . Oxygen cycle . Oxygen exists as oxygen gas (O₂) and ozone (O₃) as well as in compounds such as water (H₂O) and carbon dioxide (CO₂). . . In the biosphere (worldwide sum of all ecosystems): . Oxygen is released by photosynthesis | Oxygen is absorbed by respiration (breathing organisms) | . In the atmosphere: . Oxygen is formed through UV light: water –&gt; oxygen + hydrogen – this process is photolysis | Oxygen is removed from the atmosphere through respiration (decay of organisms and weathering of rocks) | . Ecosystem Services . Ecosystem services provide clean air, plant pollination and fertile soil. However, this is being threatened by human activity (e.g climate change). Ecosystem services are classified according to their products and functions. . Source . Natural products that are converted for use by humans (e.g coal) . Sinks . Natural processes that absorb waste (bacteria in the soil breaking down human waste) . Services . Natural environment that don’t produce consumeable resources (e.g forests absorbing carbon dioxide and producing oxygen) . Spirituality . Providing spiritual experiences (e.g Aboriginal connection with land) . . Sustainability challenges . Sustainability is the ongoing capacity of the environment to support the lives of organisms. Using resources sustainably reduces the impacts humans have on the natural environment. . Fishing case study . Fish are a vital food source (15% of animal protein eaten by 3 billion people daily) and employment source (540 million people in fishing and aquaculure). However, fish levels are in serious decline and most fishing is unsustainable. Many species will not be able o recover. Fishing management is now occuring but it may be too late. . Worldviews . We all live in one world but we can differing views of varying degrees. Usually, we are either human-centric or earth-centric. The New Ecological Paradigm is an example of a measure of worldview. . Biodiversity . Biodiversity refers to the variety of living organisms on the planet. It is measured by number of species present in a particular ecosystem/region. . Biodiversity under threat . The loss of biodiversity impacts ecosystem services. Loss of biodiversity is caused by human activity: . habitat change (e.g deforestation) | overexploitation of resources (e.g fresh air) | pollution (land, air, water) | invasive species | climate change | . 36% of species are threatened with extinction. . Case study: frogs . Frog species numbers are in dramatic decline due to climate change | Frogs are losing water through skin due to warmer climates | Also they are losing breeding grounds | The greatest threat is disease, as an African parasitic fungus (amphibian chytrid) is spreading and warmer temperatures is only helping | . . Climate change . Greenhouses gases such as carbon dioxide (caused by fossil fuel burning), methane (caused by livestock farming), nitrous oxide (caused by fertiliser) and flourinated gases (from fridges) is contributing to global warming. As a result, species and ecosystem services can be threatened. This is becasue climate change alters the conditions in which ecosystems develop, flourish, or decay. . Pollution . Pollution is any substance released into the environment that has harmful or poisnonus effects. They can impact the ability of the natural environment to provide ecosystem services. . Air pollution . Air polution is the contamination of the atmosphere, usually through the release of harmful gases. It can be local (e.g factory and smokestacks) but can also be large-scale pollution (e.g cities) that affect large areas . Water pollution . Water pollution is the contamination of water sources (rivers, lakes, oceans, etc) through the release of harmful substances. It can be caused by human activities near water (e.g shipping, oil drilling) or land acivities (littering, land clearing). . . Land pollution . Land pollution is the contamination of land areas through the release of harmful substances. On a local scale, pollution can occur in forms such as soil contamination (e.g old petrol station sites) or on larger scales (e.g increasing salinity in the Murray-Darling Basin). . . Land changes caused by human activity . Loss of productivity and decline in fertitlty due to human activities is called land degradation. It contributes to climate change and there are three types of land degradation. . Soil degradation Loss of soil fertility | Often caused by: | . large machinery/animals compacting soil | becoming acidic | loss of nutrients - Examples include salinity (buildup of salt) | . | Soil erosion Soil gradually worn away | Often caused by deforestation (as cleared land is more vulnerable to erosion than land with plants) | . | Ecosystem decline Natural ecosystems become degraded through: | . loss of vegetation | invasive species | decline in water quality - Can lead to desertification - process of which become fertile land becomes desert | . | Soil degradation – salinity . Salt is a natural part of the environment. However, when the water table rises then more salt is brought up to the surface, which kills plants and turns freshwater into salt water. . Sometimes, irrigation can cause increased salinity as it increases the amount of water in the soil. . . Ecosystem decline . Deforestation . Land clearing occurs to provide for farmland | Ecosystem services don’t have economic values so aren’t as valued as much | As a result less oxygen is produced and natural habitats are threatened | . Invasive species . Groups of species that have been introduced in areas they are not native to are called invasive species | Ecosystems around the world can be threatened by invasive species | Sometimes invasive species are introduced deliberately, othertimes they are unintentional | Invasive species can disrupt the balance of the eocsystem, degrade the land, and impact local populations | . Water degradation . Reduction in quality and quantity of clean fresh water | Caused by use of water in homes, factories, agriculture, and infrastructure, as well as polution | Dams disrupt the flow of water which floods some areas and drains others, which impacts ecosystem services (e.g fresh water provision, fertile soil, food production) | Water pollution (contamination of rivers, lakes, oceans, etc) can cause people to lose access to safe and clean drinking water | Animals can die and popuation numbers can decline | Food sources are lost, and in some extreme cases this leads to food shortages | Water pollution is the result of human activities… shipping | fishing | oil drilling | . | and land activities… using fertilisers and pesticides | littering | clearing land | . | . Case study: Murray-Darling Basin . In the Murray-Darling Basin, which accounts for 39% of Australia’s income (used for food exports), salinity is increasing and as a result plants and animals are dying. This is due to the capturing of rainwater in dams by farmers. . As a result, salt interception is being used to pump salty water and trap salt. Then, the salt is sold off for table salt. . Damn dams . There are many reasons to build dams, one being hydroelectricity. However, dams can cause significant environmental impact. . . . This marks the beginning of the Abbreviation Project. Basically, everything from now on has been cut down in order to get the main points required for a multiple choice exam! . Coastal Environments . Continually changing due to natural and human activity | Affected by human activity which causes coastal degradation | Scale: Local: litter on a beach | Regional: Oil spill | Global: Rubber ducks being released into ocean | . | Coastal degradation causes loss of plant/animal species | Examples of coastal degradation: increase of sand in ocean | changing the coastline (e.g human structures) | toxic algae | . | . Spatial variations . Spatial variations are the differences between different locations. | Natural factors: atmosphere - gas surrounding earth | biosphere - living things on earth | hydrosphere - water on earth | lithosphere - outer rocky layer of earth | . | Human factors Tourism | Cleared vegetation | Mining and roads | Land reclamation | . | Where coastlines are significantly altered by humans they are known as anthropogenic coasts | . Climate change . Human activities such as land clearing and fossil fuel burning has caused more carbon dioxide to be present in the atmosphere. This results in global warming. Global warming affects coastlines and ecosystems, and as a result sea levels are rising which in turn causes: . increased beach erosion | increased flooding | salt water entering freshwater sources | increase in extreme weather events | . Case study: Great Barrier Reef . The Great Barrier Reef (GBR) in Queensland contains a lot of coral. Rising sea temperatures will result in coral bleaching, and sea levels will rise. In addition, ocean acidification will occur where more carbon dioxide is in the water. This can reduce the amount of carbonate in the water that impacts the ability of animals to create shells. .",

Equations part of the In a Nutshell series on Adrian’s Study Club | Valency | Balancing | Rule | Difference between subscript and coefficient Example | . | Footnotes and Other Notes | . | . . It is important to familiarise yourself with word and chemical equations. You should also practice balancing word and chemical equations. . An equation has two parts: the reactant on the left, and the products on the right. Plus signs + denote the separation between different substances and arrow signs –&gt; separate reactant (left) and product (right) sides of the equation. . There are three things you have to consider: . Valency | Balancing | The Rule | The third option is especially true if there’s something above the arrow (e.g photosynthesis) or if it’s an acid/base reaction. . Valency . Take this neutralisation reaction of an acid and a base . CuCO₃ + 2HNO₃ –&gt; Cu(NO₃)₂ + H₂O + CO₂ . It’s already balanced (which is looked at in the next section), but more importantly, it respects the valency. As copper(II) has a valency of 2+ and nitrate has an overall valency of 1- we can use the crossover method and determine that we need two nitrate molecules to balance one copper atom. . Balancing . Take this wonderful nice equation of photosynthesis. . sunlight carbon dioxide + water –––––––––––&gt; glucose + oxygen chlorophyll . Without balancing, this would be . CO₂ + H₂O –&gt; C₆H₁₂O₆ + O₂ . But of course, this is impossible, because there is 1 carbon on the reactant side while there is 6 on the carbon side, and 3 oxygen on reactant side, and 8 oxygen on the product side, and 2 hydrogen on the reactant side, and 12 hydrogen on the product side. . We can use our knowledge from Maths and find a number that would multiply the atoms so the equation becomes balanced. . Now how about we place a 6 in front of all of the substances except for glucose… . 6CO₂ + 6H₂O –&gt; C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂ . Now we have on both sides: . 6 carbon | 18 oxygen | 12 hydrogen | . Yay! This is known as the law of conservation of mass. . Rule . The final thing to take consideration of is the rule. For acid/base reactions, you can test yourself on Quizlet here: . Test yourself on Quizlet . Difference between subscript and coefficient . The subscript shows the number of atoms in a molecule. The coefficient shows the number of molecules. They both represent quantity. . Example . H₂SO₄ means there are 2 hydrogen atoms, 1 sulfur atom and 4 oxygen atom in a molecule/substance 3H₂SO₄ means there are 3 molecules of sulfuric acid (also known as dihydrogen sulfur quadoxide) with 2 hydrogen, 1 sulfur and 4 oxygen in each. Therefore in total there is 6 hydrogen, 3 sulfur and 12 oxygen. . . . Footnotes and Other Notes . 4.1 Writing and Balancing Chemical Equations on OpenTextBC &#8617; . |",

    "title": "In a Nutshell: How Neurons Work Together",
    "content": "How Neurons Work Together . part of the In a Nutshell series on Adrian’s Study Club . Complete . When a stimulus is presented, there are a number of processes that takes effect before a response is initiated. Take a humble bumblebee buzzing around. According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly. Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. However, for this example, we’ll assume that the bee is in fact, flying around and being a general annoyance to someone like Barry. . Firstly, Barry’s sensory neurons (in this case, a photoreceptor) sees the bee. Barry’s photoreceptor is a part of the Peripheral Nervous System. It sees the bee and sends nerve impulses (electrical signals) which reach the brain, through interneurons. These interneurons are part of Barry’s Central Nervous System, which consists of the brain and the spinal cord. This area coordinates all of Barry’s activities and what Barry does with this information. The brain has many different types of neurons, too much for Barry to possibly comprehend! . Secondly, the sensory neurons connect to the motor neurons via interneurons. They transfer information between the sensory neurons and the motor neurons. Finally, the nerve impulse, carried over many neurotransmitters, synapses, and neurons, is brought to the motor neuron, through the spinal cord (which has a lot of nerve cells). . The motor neuron controls our muscles and organs. For Barry, it’s the motor neurons that tell his arm to swat the bee away.

Interconnections these days are fueled by the ever growing technological advancements that are being produced these days. . The Internet has been a major proponent of Interconnections, which have been important to the idea of connecting with people on the other side of the world in real time. Containerisation has allowed deliveries to be performed quicker than usual, cutting down on costs and expanding international trading routes. . These sort of interconnections have allowed us to interconnect like never before. While interconnections are predominantly a good thing, they have also hurt us, with things such as expanding criminal activity from a domestic scale to an international scale, the result of tourism destroying the environment, and many more things. . Interconnections do not have to be international, in fact usually they are seen on a local scale. For example, you are interconnected with your community, with your local council serving as a hub, and with your local council connected to the state government which is connected to the federal government etc. etc. .",

It consists of a variety of geographical features that may be characteristic of that area in particular. . There are many different types of landscapes, including mountain landscapes (which feature mountains created by tectonic plates), coastal landscapes where a land area comes into correct contact with the sea, and riverine landscapes where there is a water system that flows through it such as a creek, stream or river. Desert landscapes have a specific definition, that is, that only 250 mm or less rain falls onto the area per year. Karst landscapes are formed when easily dissolvable bedrock, or the rock directly a land surface such as limestone, is worn away by water that is slightly acidic. Finally, human landscapes are artificial landscapes created by humans, such as city skylines and schools. . While a landscape covers a certain area featuring similar characteristics, a landform is a specific feature in a landscape. Example of landforms in a mountain landscape include mountain ranges, mountains, ridges, glaciers and volcanos. . Many natural and human landscapes are formed and transformed by many different processes, including geomorphic, hydrological, and atmospheric processes. You are about to explore four of the geomorphic processes that form and transform the Earth: tectonic activity, erosion, deposition and weathering. To understand these processes, you first need to know about the world beneath your feet. . You may be used to thinking of the Earth as a solid ball like a giant shot-put, but in fact this is far from reality. The Earth is more like a giant peach with a skin that is very thin and a core at the centre surrounded by it’s soft flesh. Scientists believe that the Earth is made up of four layers. . The outer layer of the Earth’s surface, which is the crust, is broken into large pieces called tectonic plates. These plates are around 100 kilometers thick and fit together like enormous pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. Currents in the red-hot molten material under these tectonic plates cause them to move about. . In some places, these tectonic places are being pushed into one another. This is called converging, and it creates mountains. .",

It does look pretty good but there are always things to note when you&#39;re working off something like this. Firstly, the source for this is a HTML document instead of GFM so it&#39;s not human-readable. Secondly, `jekyll build` seems to not like the Therefore sign and has changed anything in a container with it to Times New Roman.

However, with finals approaching close and our lack of neccessity for learning about Roman numerals, migration to the new platform will be done from topics of most importance to topics of least importance. This also means that topic areas from previous years that don’t get covered now won’t be prioritised as much. Many study notes will only be migrated from Google Drive to Adrian Study Club as part of a long-term project in 2020. . Personally I wish we could organise the chapters into concepts. However, that would unnecessarily take a lot of time and the search function + chapter headings already detail something if you wanted to find it. We also seriously recommend using BBC Bitesize. If you’d like to volunteer to volunteer moving chapter headings into concepts (which requires merging Year 7 stuff with Year 9 stuff for example) please let me know. We might consider merging in the future but it isn’t high priority right now. . Also consider making your own written study notes as well. Most of this stuff is written in your workbooks/summary books and this just serves as a digital record of the work we do in class. . The roadmap allows us to keep track of what needs to be completed, what has already been completed and what is most important for completion. You can view each subject’s roadmap on it’s parent page.

Alternatively, the topic/chapter never had any work done on it, and if it was from 2017/2018 it probably won’t ever be completed. On the old Google Doc the term redundant means that it wasn’t finished by the time it was required and so we stopped working to finish it. Here, it has a different definition. **Note that for some chapters the redundant label won’t be used and they will just be left out of their corresponding subject’s roadmap entirely. .

Earth is made up of tectonic plates; plates of crust that float on the mantle. Here’s a table of the different parts of the Earth. . Part of the Earth Description . Crust | Thin and rocky | . Mantle | Semi-molten rock | . Outer Core | Liquid nickel and iron | . Inner Core | Solid nickel and iron | . Sometimes we refer to them in regions. . Part of the Earth Description . Lithosphere | Made up of crust and upper mantle | . Aesthenosphere | Below the lithosphere | . Earth’s crust is a thin and rocky section of the Earth that is about 8km thick. It floats on top of semi-molten rock in the mantle, which in turn floats on nickel and iron. . Wegener’s Theory of Continental Drift . Alfred Wegener theorised that the Earth’s crust was made up of plates that were floating on denser magma. This was called the theory of continental drift. Today, the theory of tectonic plates succeeds continental drift theory. He also theorised that the continents of the world used to be one gigantic supercontinent, which he named Pangea. There were a number of different supercontinents as land broke away and joined together repeatedly. . . Evidence for the theory of continental drift . Evidence for this includes: . The east coast of South America and the west coast of South America match up together | There are similar patterns for rocks on different continents (e.g the Appalachian Mountains in North America seem to continue into the Caledonian Mountains in Scandinavia) | Similar fossils have been found on different continents, for example, fossils of the Mesosaurus have been found in both in both South Africa and Brazil. Cold areas such as Greenland have tropical fossils, and South Africa has ice scratches on rocks despite it’s warm climate. | There are coal deposits in cold parts of the world (such as Antarctica) and glacial deposits in hot parts of the world (such as South Africa, Australia, South America and India) which seems to suggest that these landmasses were once joined together. | Tectonic and seismic activity seems to concentrate on the boundaries of the plates, known as the Ring of Fire. | The magnetic north pole continually moved around1 | Tectonic activity is the reason that our natural terrain is extremely varied. The Mid-Ocean Ridge and Marianas Trench are some examples of terrain formed by a divergent boundary and a convergent boundary respectively. The San Andreas Fault in California is a good example of a transform boundary. . . Moooooove over! . How do plates move? . Plates move in three primary ways2. . Divergent Boundaries . Divergent boundaries are when two plates separate and move away from each other. . | Convergent Boundaries . Convergent boundaries are when two plates move towards each other, forcing one plate to dive beneath the other. This process is known as subduction. . | Transform Boundaries . Transform boundaries are when two plates slide past each other, causing a fault. A good example of a transform boundary is the San Andreas Fault in California, United States. . | Why do plates move? . Plates move because of convection currents in the molten liquid rock in the mantle. . . Heat generated from the really hot outer core rises, and when it gets to the top, is blocked by the crust, spreads out at the top, and falls when it begins to cool. This moves the boundaries of the plates. As a result, the crust is affected by changing boundaries and this is what causes magma to upwell, usually at the site of divergent boundary (volcanic activity). . History of Tectonic Plates1 . Alfred Wegener proposed the theory of continental drift, and that continents “plower This was due to the geographical evidence where coastlines fit together. Paleontologists – fossil scientists, found fossils on different continents. Moving into the present, underwater seisometers meant to alert nuclear activity showed that there was increased volcanic and seismic activity around the edges of plates. This, which occurred in the 1960s, basically made plate tectonic theory the dominant accepted theory for how the Earth was shaped. . . Folds, Faults and Subduction . Folding3 . Earth’s crust bends, and this causes folding | When plates collide and are forced into each other, folding occurs. This process is known as compression. | Horizontal compression occurs which creates mountains. | This process occurs at collision zones. | . . In folding mountains, the part folded upwards is the anticline and the part folded downwards is the syncline. . . . More on Fold Mountains on BBC Bitesize GCSE Geography . Faults . Tectonic plates horizontally slip | This process is known as rifting, where the lithosphere is torn apart | . In fault-block mountains, the raised block is the horst while the lowered block is the graben. . . Subduction4 . Destructive Plate Margins on BBC Bitesize . A geological process at convergent boundaries, where one plate dives under another | Most common with an oceanic plate, and a continental plate | The oceanic plate is denser, and it moves below the continental plate | This triggers earthquakes | This process occurs at the subduction zone. | . . When subduction occurs, it usually means that crust will be subducted too. This means that mantle from the asthenosphere will be upwelled to form new crust. . . Earthquakes . Seismic and volcanic activity are more likely at the boundaries of tectonic plates. Most of the sliding, pushing, pulling, seafloor spreading and upwelling occurs along the tectonic plates. A large number of earthquakes and volcanic activity occur around the Pacific Plate. This is known as the Ring of Fire. . . We can measure how much energy an earthquake produces using the Richter scale, which is a scale of magnitude. Every increase of 1 on the scale is an increase of amplitude by 10. Familiarise yourself with the Richter scale now. . Magnitude Description Mercalli intensity Average earthquake effects Average frequency of occurrence globally (estimated) . 1.0–1.9 | Micro | I | Microearthquakes, not felt, or felt rarely. Recorded by seismographs.[30] | Continual/several million per year | . 2.0–2.9 | Minor | I to II | Felt slightly by some people. No damage to buildings. | Over one million per year | . 3.0–3.9 |   | III to IV | Often felt by people, but very rarely causes damage. Shaking of indoor objects can be noticeable. | Over 100,000 per year | . 4.0–4.9 | Light | IV to VI | Noticeable shaking of indoor objects and rattling noises. Felt by most people in the affected area. Slightly felt outside. Generally causes none to minimal damage. Moderate to significant damage very unlikely. Some objects may fall off shelves or be knocked over. | 10,000 to 15,000 per year | . 5.0–5.9 | Moderate | VI to VII | Can cause damage of varying severity to poorly constructed buildings. At most, none to slight damage to all other buildings. Felt by everyone. | 1,000 to 1,500 per year | . 6.0–6.9 | Strong | VIII to X | Damage to a moderate number of well-built structures in populated areas.Earthquake-resistant structuressurvive with slight to moderate damage. Poorly designed structures receive moderate to severe damage. Felt in wider areas; up to hundreds of miles/kilometers from the epicenter. Strong to violent shaking in epicentral area. | 100 to 150 per year | . 7.0–7.9 | Major | X or greater | Causes damage to most buildings, some to partially or completely collapse or receive severe damage. Well-designed structures are likely to receive damage. Felt across great distances with major damage mostly limited to 250 km from epicenter. | 10 to 20 per year | . 8.0–8.9 | Great |   | Major damage to buildings, structures likely to be destroyed. Will cause moderate to heavy damage to sturdy or earthquake-resistant buildings. Damaging in large areas. Felt in extremely large regions. | One per year | . 9.0 and greater |   |   | At or near total destruction – severe damage or collapse to all buildings. Heavy damage and shaking extends to distant locations. Permanent changes in ground topography. | One per 10 to 50 years | . . Tsunamis . Many earthquakes occur underwater. When earthquakes occur, they can trigger waves. Waves travel long distances, and as the water gets shallower, the waves slow down. Then, they become higher and more closely packed. Adrian personally suggests you to check Tsunamis on BBC Bitesize for a better understanding! . Tsunamis on BBC Bitesize GCSE Edexcel . . . Lava and Magma . NOTE: Volcanoes will remain somewhat Redundant because it isn’t being covered at Adrian’s school. If you’d like to contribute, feel free to.

Investment in a nutshell . Businesses, governments and individuals carry out investment. There are many different type of investment, including: . savings account | term deposits | shares | cash management account | managed fund | property | superannuation | debentures and unsecured notes | . Financing an investment can be done either through personal savings or borrowing. Advantages of saving for an investment means no interest is paid, but you might had to have extra costs (e.g paying rent while saving for a house) . Loans have different features. Personal loans can be secured or unsecured. Home loans can either have a fixed interest rate or a variable interest rate. . A fixed interest rate is a constant rate. The repayment amount is always the same. . A variable interest rate moves up or down depending on the market. A variable rate continually changes and fluctuates. This is usually done through the RBA. . An income and expenditure account is a record of income earned and money spent during the previous week. Take a look at an example below: . Date Income Amount Date Expense Amount . 1 Jul | Balance available to invest | $30.00 | 1 Jul | Rent | $60.00 | . 1 Jul | Pay for casual work | $200.00 | 2 Jul | Magazine | $8.00 | . 3 Jul | Medicare refund | $17.00 | 4 Jul | Groceries | $27.00 | . 6 Jul | Interest on deposit | $47.00 | 5 Jul | Donated to Red Cross | $5.00 | .   | Total income | $294.00 | 7 Jul | Mobile phone | $20.00 | . ……. | ………………………………… | ……….. |   | Total expenses | $120.00 | .   |   |   | 7 Jul | Balance available to invest | $174.00 | .   |   |   | ……. | ……………………………….. | ……… | . 8 Jul | Balance available to invest | $174.00 | 8 Jul | Rent | $60.00 | . 8 Jul | Pay for casual work | $208.00 | 9 Jul | Groceries | $29.00 | . 12 Jul | Medicare refund | $20.00 | 11 Jul | Doctor bills | $18.00 | . 14 Jul | Birthday gift | $50.00 | 11 Jul | New fishing rod | $50.00 | .   | Total income | $452.00 | 12 Jul | Newspaper bill | $18.00 | .   |   |   | 13 Jul | Entertainment | $36.00 | .   |   |   | 14 Jul | Petrol for car | $23.00 | .   |   |   |   | Total expenses | $234.00 | .   | Balance available to invest | $218.00 | 14 Jul | Balance available to invest | $218.00 | . . Ethical investments . Investors might only choose to make investments ethically. This is known as ethical investment . This can be done in two ways: . Negative screening: avoids investment in some firms such as cigarette or alcohol companies | Positive screening: limits investing to desirable firms such as renewable energy or healthcare | Case Study 1 . Tassal is a company operating in Tasmania that produces sustainable and environmentally friendly fish. In addition to their strong emphasis on being environmentally friendly, it develops local community support programs and offers scholarships to students studying aquaculture. . Case Study 2 . Bendigo Bank’s Community Bank Program allows those in rural and remote areas to have access to normal banking, which allows communities the right to operate a Bendgo Bank franchise branch. Revenue is shared between the company and the community, and Bendigo Bank provides banking support. . This can be considered as Corporate Social Responsibility.

With so many options, businesses have to differentiate their product. Product differentiation is when products that are the same or similar are made to appear different and/or better than those of their competitors. . Customer service . Customer service is important to customers | Presentation, atmosphere and exclusivity can capture a customer’s interest | For example, a really nice restaurant with a tasting menu, table service and wine selections will be differentiated from a fish and chips store. | . Convenience . Products that are quick, convenient, and easy to use are differentiated from products that take ages to make | Uncle Bens is one such company which provides quick cook rice! It was so popular of Duke of Ed!!! | . Environment &amp; social and ethical issues . Products that are more environmentally-oriented may increase scales | The Body Shop is a good case study of an environmentally-friendly company. For more information, see Ethical investments. | Ethical consumerism: buying products that are not harmful to the environment, animals and society | Companies that operate ethically (e.g don’t exploit workers or conduct animal testing) can become more popular with consumers | Fairtrade-certified products have been certified for ethical and sustainable conduct | .

Arguably, Quilton 29-ply toilet paper will be more premium than Coles 1-ply industrial toilet paper. | Luxurious items that are branded suggest an image of a product’s quality | . . Product promotion strategies . Promotion . Promotion is the methods used by a business to inform, persuade and remind customers about its products. This can involve: . attracting new customers through raising awareness of a product | increasing brand loyalty by reinforcing the image of the product | encouraging existing customers to purchase more of the product | encouraging new and existing customers to purchase new products | . A promotion mix is the various promotion strategies a business uses in its promotional campaign. Do not confuse advertising with promotion; advertising is one part of the promotion mix! . Advertising . Advertising is a paid, non-personal message often distributed through mass media. It allows a business to reach either a large audience or a small distinct population. This could involve: . mass marketing (TV, radio, newspapers) | direct marketing catelogues (catalogues mailed to individual households) | telemarketing (contacting potential customers by telephone) | online advertising (Google, social media such as Facebook and Twitter) | billboards (large signs in strategic locations) | . Oh wait… that last one wasn’t exactly advertising. . Relationship marketing . Relationship marketing is the development of long-term relationships with individual customers. It creates customer loyalty by meeting the needs of customers on an individual basis. . Sponsorship . Sponsorship promotes a product by assosciating it with a specific event. It can be used to promote a product towards a specific demographic with a common interest. Product endorsement occurs when celebrities express their appreciation and support for a product. . Publicity . Publicity is any free news story about a business’s products. It can be negative, but when positive can enhance the image of a product and raise awareness of it. . Sales promotion . Sales promotion is the use of activities or materials as direct inducements to customers. The main aims of it is to entice new customers and encourage trial purchase of the product. Examples include coupons, loyalty reward programs and samples. . Gender . Advertising is often targeted towards one gender or another, and it utilises stereotypes to reinforce this message. This is now starting to be criticised because a lot of the time sex appeal is being used to advertise this product. . I’m thinking of an example of an advert with sex appeal but I’m trying to keep it PG-13 on Adrian’s Study Club. . . Target market . Market segmentation occurs when the total market is subdivided into groups of people who share one or more common cahracteristics. The market can be subdivided into groups such as age, gender, income level, educational background, geographical location, lifestyle and family structure. Once a market is segmented one of these segments is designated as the target market. . . Target market is the group of customers to whom the business intends to sell its product. Promotion efforts are concentrated on that group. A business can have a primary target market (where most marketing resources are directed) and a secondary target market (a less important segment). The primary target market generates most revenue while the secondary is a good alternative and back-up plan (in case there is a loss of customers from the primary target market). . Businesses that target small segments is known as niche marketing. Niche marketing targets a segment within a segment (or a micromarket!) So if you’re a cosplay designer, you’re targeting a very niche market. A very niche market. .",

Marketing of junk food is being criticised as childhood obesity rates rise, especially as it is portrayed as healthy when this is not the case. . Invasion of privacy . While most websites infer consent to track them, etc, most consumers don’t know how their data is being used, when in fact it is probably being used for advertising purposes.

This means someone with no dependants and a small apartment can handle more debt than a large family and house. Ability to repay is linked to your financial position, including: . present and future income | value of assets | outstanding debts | . Failing to repay debts can result in repossession (compulsory acquisition of goods bough on credit should debts not be repaid). . Guarantor . **People with poor credit ratings might need a guarantor: someone who guarantees to pay back money if the borrower does not. ** . Usually people go guarantor because they love/trust the person and are unaware of obligations as a guarantor. Before going guarantor, someone should receive a copy of the loan contract, and an explanation of rights and liabilities if the debt isn’t paid. . ### .",

This section is more basic, and omits FOIL, difference of two squares, perfect squares, and more advanced concepts. . Expanding brackets allows you to look at an equation in a different way. To expand brackets, use the distributive law. . a(b + c) = a × b + a × c = ab + ac a(b + c) = a × b - a × c = ab - ac . You can express this using visual representation. . . To the contrary, you can factorise expressions to make them shorter. . Firstly, find the highest common factor (HCF), and then place that outside the brackets. Dividing each term by it, leaving the results in brackets, while using the appropriate operation. . For example, 10x + 15y has a HCF of 5, thus, in it’s factorised form, would be 5(2x + 3y). . Index notation is a convenient method of describing repeated notation. For example 165 is equal to 16 x 16 x 16 x 16 x 16 where 16 is the base and 5 is the index or exponent. . The index law for multiplying expressions which both have indexes is easy. . xm x xn = xm+n. xm / xn = xm-n. . A number raised to the power of 0 is always one.

This section is more advanced, and omits algebraic language, basic operations, distributive law, and other basic concepts. It is also suggested you read about Algebraic techniques. For more advanced stuff, you should refer to Year 9 Maths Chapter 2. This section is more basic and omits simulataneous equations . Linear equations are when the power of the pronumeral is 1 and there is only one solution. Another type of equation is the simple quadratic equation, which can be expressed as such: . x^2 = c . The power of the pronumeral is 2. Depending on the value of c, x can have zero to many solutions. . x^2 = c is a simple quadratic equation. If c &gt; 0, then your solutions are as follows: . x = √c | X= -√c | . If c = 0 there is one solution, which is x = 0. . However, if c &lt; 0 then there aren’t any solutions because x^2 is always positive. . An inequality is a statement of the form: . LHS &gt; RHS - greater than - 7 &gt; 2 | LHS ≥ RHS - greater than or equal to - 7 ≥ 7, 7 ≥ 2 | LHS &lt; RHS - less than - 2 &lt; 7 | LHS ≤ RHS - less than or equal to - 2 ≤ 2, 2 ≤ 7 | . Inequalities can be reversed, for example, x &lt; 3 and 3 &gt; x is equivalent. They can also be represented on a number line, as follows. . . As you can see, the number line is on the x axis, with an arrow above the corresponding numbers. For example, in the first example, you can see that x is larger or equal to than five. As it is inclusive of five, there is a filled circle. On the contrary, with a statement that lacks the ‘or equal to’ statement, it is exclusive, like in the second example, where 6 is excluded, thus the open circle. . Tl;dr: If the statement contains an ‘or equal to’ statement within the inequality, then the circle is open. Otherwise, it is closed. . A range can be represented as a segment on the number line. . Solving inequalities can be performed by finding an equivalent inequality to the given. . Adding or subtracting an expression from both sides | Multiplying or dividing both sides by any positive number | Multiplying or dividing both sides by a negative number AND reversing the inequality symbol | Swapping LHS and RHS and reversing the inequality symbol | . The above represent methods in which an equivalent inequality can be obtained. . . Problem solving - Two people painting a wall . You can use equations to answer a question such as the following: . Kingston prepares a rabbit for sacrifice in 8 hours. Oscar does that in 6 hours. If Kingston and Oscar worked together, how long would it take to sacrifice a rabbit? . Answer: . Kingston prepares ⅛ of a rabbit in 1 hour. Oscar prepares ⅙ of a rabbit in 1 hour. ∴ together, they prepare ⅛ + ⅙ of a rabbit in 1 hour. ⅛ + ⅙ = 3/24 + 4/24 = 7/24 of a rabbit in 1 hour . Therefore: . One sacrificed rabbit = 24/7 . Unfortunately there doesn’t seem to be one easy way to explain why we flip the fraction. You idiot its because you have to divide it by 7 hours to get 1 hour worth of rabbits . Or! . Kingston prepares 3 rabbits in 24 hours Oscar prepares 4 rabbits in 24 hours ∴ together, they prepare (3 + 4) rabbits in 24 hours. 3 + 4 = 7 = 7 rabbits in 24 hours . Therefore: . One sacrifice rabbit = 24/7 .",

Table of Contents . 2D Shapes | 3D Shapes | Capacity and volume | Pythag | . . 2D Shapes . Special quadrilaterals include the parallelogram, rhombus, the kite and the trapezium. The formula for each 2D shape slightly varies. . Depending on your personal preference, you may use either the Textbook formula or the Standard formula. . Textbook formula is as follows: . Parallelogram - Base x Height (A = bh) Rhombus and Kite - ½ x Diagonal x x Diagonal y (A = ½ xy) Trapezium - ½ x Sum of parallel sides x Height (A = ½ h(a + b) . However, you may prefer the Standard formula: . Parallelogram - A = bh where b is the base and h is the height Rhombus and Kite - A = pq/2 where p and q each represent diagonals Trapezium - A = ½ h(a + b) or A = ab/2 h where a and b are the sum of parallel sides and where h is the height . The ratio of the area of a circle to the square of its radius is equal to π. Therefore, the area of a circle is known as πr2 where r is the radius. . A half circle is known as a semi circle, and a quarter circle is known as a quadrant. Therefore, their respective area formulas are ½ πr2 and ¼ πr2. . A sector is formed by dividing a circle with two radii (radii is plural for radius) . A sector’s area can be determined by calculating a fraction of the area of a circle with the same radius. Let ‘θ’ be the angle inside the sector. . Fraction = θ/360 Sector area = θ/360 x πr2 . A 2D composite shape is a shape that is composed of more than one basic shape (circle, square, triangle, etc.) . Here are your basic shapes: . . And here is a composite shape, that can be split into multiple parts: . . The figure above, which we will call ‘N’, is made up of different size rectangles and squares. . The area of N, or any composite shape for the matter, can be found by adding or subtracting the areas of more basic shapes. . . 3D Shapes . A prism is a polyhedron (solid figure with multiple faces) with a constant cross-section. . The cross section is parallel to the two identical, congruent ends. The other sides are parallelograms or rectangles. . The volume of a prism, where V is the volume, A is the area of the cross section and h is the perpendicular height is: . V = Ah . The volume of a cylinder is: . V = πr2h . A net is a 2D representation of all surfaces unfolded. When folded, it forms the desired 3D outcome. . The surface area of a prism is the sum of the areas of all it’s faces. For example, a cube x with squares y, each with a side length of z would be calculated as: . A = 6z2 . . Capacity and volume . Volume is measured in cubic units. . Cubic millimeters (mm3) [1000mm3 is equal to 1 milliliter] | Cubic centimeter (cm3) [1cm3 is equal to 1 milliliter] | Cubic meter (m3) [1m3 is equal to 1000 litres which is equal to 1 kilolitre] | . Conversions for volume are as followed . x10003 x1003 x103 km3 -&gt; m3 -&gt; cm3 --&gt; mm3 /10003 / 1003 /103 . Capacity is the volume of liquids or gas that containers hold. In the metric system (the system that literally everyone except for the Americans use, oh wait, that’s celsius), there are some common units you should remember. . Millilitre (mL) | Litre (L) | Kilolitre (kL) | Megalitre (ML) | . Some common conversions mentioned above might make more sense now. . 1mL = 1cm3 | 1 L = 1000mL | 1 kL = 1000L = 1m3 | . To find the volume of a rectangular prism, you would multiply the length by the breadth by the height. . V = length x breadth x height . The volume of a cube (also a rectangular prism) is ‘V = s^3’ where s is one side length. . . Pythag . The hypotenuse is the longest side of a right angled triangle, opposite the right angle. Pythagoras’ theorem dictates that the square of the hypotenuse is the sum of the squares of the other two shorter sides. . Therefore, where a and b is the length of the side of the shorter sides, and c is the hypotenuse: . a² + b² = c² . A Pythagorean triad (also known as a Pythagorean triple) is a set of three integers which satisfy Pythagoras’ theorem. . For example, 3-4-5 is a Pythagorean triad because 3² + 4² = 5², or 9 + 16 = 25. . Surds are numbers that cannot be written as a fraction. Written as a decimal, the decimal numbers repeat, thus, surds are also irrational. Surds contain a √ sign when written in the simplest form. . Pythagoras’ theorem dictates that: . a² + b² = c² therefore √(a² + b²) = c . where the brackets next to the √ sign indicate its constituents are under the square root. . However: . √(a² + b²) ≠ a + b . Using your algebra skills, you can find the length of a shorter side using Pythagoras’ theorem. . For a triangle with sides a and 24, where 25 is the hypotenuse: . a² + b² = c² a² + 24² = 25² a² + 576 = 625 a² = 49 (Subtract 576 from both sides.) ∴ a = √49 = 7 .",

You will want to refer to Year 7 Maths Chapter 4 for basic knowledge of fractions, decimals and percentages. This section is more advanced and omits finance and other basic concepts. . Some brief definition on simple, but essential terminology: . Numerator: the number on top of the fraction bar, being divided by the denominator | Equivalent Fraction: fractions that are equal to each other, more often than not with different numbers in representation | Improper Fraction: a fraction in which the numerator is larger than the denominator | Multiples: a number that may be divided by a certain number without remainder | Reciprocal: the reverse of a fraction, often labelled as “flipping” the number on a fraction, essentially meaning that the numerator and denominator switch places. If number is a mixed numeral, convert to an improper fraction to find the reciprocal | Lowest Common Multiple: the lowest number that can be divided between two specific numbers, often labelled as LCM and used in simplifying fractions | Ascending: an increasing set of numbers | Composite Number: a positive integer which has a divisor that is not 1 or itself | Denominator: the number on the bottom of the fraction bar in a fraction that is dividing the numerator | Proper Fraction: a fraction that is less than 1 with the numerator being less than the denominator | Mixed Numeral: a number that contains a whole number and a fraction | Factors: can be multiplied together to result in a specific number | Highest Common Factor: the largest common factor between 2 numbers | Descending: numbers in a decreasing order | Rational Numbers: a number that can be expressed as a ratio | Irrational Numbers: a number that has no end, such as pi | . Any number being divided by itself, or if a fraction’s numerator and denominator are equal, the number is equal to 1. . To add and subtract fractions, one needs to make the denominators the same. Do this by finding the lowest common multiple of both denominators, and make that the new denominator. Remember that whatever you do to the denominator, you must do to the numerator. . To multiply fractions, simply multiply the numerators to achieve your numerator, and multiply the denominators to find the denominator. A method to make this easier is the “bow tie” method. To do this, look at the numbers that are opposite each other (for the denominator of the first number, the opposite would be the numerator of the next number) and see if you can “cancel” out anything (multiples and variables). Cross these out and/or replace with new numbers respectively, which, in theory, should make the equation easier. . Brendan’s Note: I don’t usually use the bow tie method unless there are variables/pronumerals, but if it’s easier for you, by all means use it. . To divide fractions, simply find the reciprocal and then multiply the fractions. It is very handy to note though, that for smaller fractions like a half, third and quarter, you should be able to easily just double, triple and quadruple your fractions respectively. . Decimals are simply another way to express parts of a whole, and utilise the base 10 metric system. They are less efficient than fractions, but easier to use. . When adding or subtracting decimals, always be wary of where the decimal point is, especially if using an algorithm. .",

    "content": "Year 8 Maths Chapter 5 - Ratios and Rates . Complete . Table of Contents . Ratios Ratios show a relationship between two (or more) related quantities, in the same unit and of the same type. | Distance, Speed and Time | . | . . Ratios . Ratios show a relationship between two (or more) related quantities, in the same unit and of the same type. . For example, a dead rabbit could have a ratio of fur to flesh, of 1:3. The colon (“:”) is used to represent ratios. A written ratio (a : b) is read as a to be or a is to b. . The order of the numbers in a ratio is important. 1:3 is not the same as 3:1. . Equivalent ratios can be formed, for example, by multiplying the ratio by the same amount. What you do to one side you must do to the other. 1:3, 2:6 and 10:30 are equivalent ratios. . Simplifying ratios can be done by dividing the ratio by the same amount, or multiplying if the ratio is not a whole number such as a fraction. You should attempt to express ratios in simplest forms. . Ratios must ALWAYS BE in the same unit. . The unitary method allows ratios to be shared into parts. For example, a ratio of 2:3 can be considered as 2 parts and 3 parts, and to divide a cost, for example, $20, can be divided into all five parts. Therefore, where 1 part is $4, 2 parts is $8 and 3 parts is $12. Hence, the ratio of 2:3 is $8:$12. . A scale drawing is a drawing which is identical to another except for its size. A scale drawing usually has a scale ratio. The scale ratio is written as Drawing (Scale) Length : Actual Length. . For example, a scale ratio of 1:100 is that the actual lengths are 100 times greater than the presented length. . A scale should begin with 1. Hence, the second number can be referred to as the scale factor. . To convert a SCALED distance to an ACTUAL distance you multiply by the scale factor, and vice versa. . Remember! . 1 km = 1000 m (kilo means 1000, however, not necessarily true when it is raised to a power) | 1 m = 100 cm | 1 cm = 10 mm | . Rates compare quantities of different units. All rates must include quantities. . The forward slash (“/”) is used to represent rates. Rates should be written in their simplest form; where the second quantity is only 1 unit (1 km, 1 minute). . The average rate is calculated by: . Dividing the total amount of CHANGE in one quantity by the total amount of change in the second quantity. | What you do to one side you must do to the other. | For example, killing 400 rabbits in 4 days = 100 rabbits in 1 day. | The unitary method is: . Finding the value of 1 unit | Going back up to the required number of units | For example: . The ratio of dead rabbits to mutated pigs is 3:5. If there are 18 dead rabbits, how many mutated pigs are there? . To solve it, you would identify that 3 parts = 18 dead rabbits . Then, divide 18 by 3 to find 1 part . Therefore, 5 parts = 30 mutated pigs. Therefore, there are 30 mutated pigs. . . Distance, Speed and Time . Distance, speed and time are important concepts for real life application of mathematics. . Terms you should know: . Speed is a measure of how fast an object is travelling. | Distance is a measure of how far an object has travelled (in this case). | Time is a measure of how much indefinite continued progress of existence and events in the past, present, and future regarded as a whole has surpassed. Woah. | . You can use two of the measures to find the third one. For example, . Where S is average speed, D is distance travelled and T is time lapsed… . S = D/T . The best way to remember the equations required is to use a DST triangle. . . Where D is the numerator of a fraction in regards to S and T, and D is the product of the equation S x T. . So… . D = S x T S = D/T T = D/S . If the speed of an object does not change over time, then the object is travelling at a constant speed. For example, when a dead rabbit driving a Prius is using cruise control at 80 km/h, then the car has a constant speed of 80 km/h. . Units should also be the same when solving DST equations. . Distance and time graphs are used to show the distance on a vertical axis and the time taken on the horizontal axis, also known as the y and x axis respectively. . Each segment shows whether the object is moving or is stopped. The steepness of any one line segment shows the speed. . Steeper lines = faster speed . Look at this crappy D/T graph (note that D/T stands for distance/time, not design and technology) . .",

You will want to refer to Year 7 Maths Chapter 4 for basic knowledge of angle relationships. This section is more advanced and omits points, rays, types of angles and other basic concepts. . Table of Contents . Angles | Polygons Angle sum of n-gon | . | Angle sums List of n-gon names | . | . . Angles . Angles sharing a vertex and an arm are called adjacent angles. | Two angles in a right angle are adjacent complementary angles. The first angle is the complement of the second angle. | You can have three or more angles in a right angle. They are not complementary. | Two angles on a straight line are adjacent supplementary angles. The first angle is the supplement of the second angle. | You can have three or more angles on a straight line. They are not supplementary. | Angles at a point and angles in a revolution add up to 360°. | Where two straight lines meet, they form two pairs of vertically opposite angles. Vertically opposite angles are equal. | If one of the four angles in vertically opposite is a right angle, then all four angles are right angles. | . Things you should see (all images are respective to the above bullet points (going down the list, starting from the left [the two images of vertically opposite angles count as one column]): . . A transversal is a line cutting two or more lines. . When a transversal crosses two or more lines, pairs of angles can be: . Corresponding | Alternate | Co-interior | Vertically opposite | Angles on a straight line | . Corresponding, alternate and co-interior angles, respectively: . Lines are parallel if they will never intersect. They are marked with indented arrows. To mark something as parallel, you use a |   | sign. | . Let AB be parallel to XY ∴ AB || XY ∵ I said so . You read this as: . Let AB be parallel to XY Therefore, AB is parallel to XY Because, I said so . Or something along those lines (hah, get it?). . If two parallel lines are cut by a transversal… . . … then corresponding and alternate angles are equal, while cointerior angles are equal to 180° (supplementary). . Fun fact! One way to remember Alternate angles is that they make a Z or a S. Salternate, Zalternate. This is sometimes not recommended by maths teachers are they get confusing. . . Polygons . A polygon is a type of shape where the number of interior angles equals the number of sides. Polygons can be convex or non-convex: . Convex polygons all have vertices pointing outside (all exterior angles are reflex angles) | Non-convex polygons have some vertices pointing inwards (at least one exterior angles is not a reflex angle) | . A regular polygon has sides of equal length and equal interior angles. For a list of polygons, see List of n-gon names. . A triangle has: . 3 sides | 3 vertices (usually labelled as A, B, and C) | 1 vertex | 3 interior angles (usually labelled ∠ABC, ∠BAC, ∠ACB) | . Triangles can be classified by interior angles: . Acute-angled triangles are where all angles are acute | Right-angled triangles are where there is one right angle | Obtuse-angled triangles are where there is one obtuse angle | . Triangles can also be classified by their side lengths . Scalene triangles are where all sides are different lengths | Isosceles triangles are when there are two sides that are the same length | Equilateral triangles are when all of the sides are of equal length | . For these triangles, they have unique properties: . Isosceles triangles have the same base angle | Equilateral triangles have angles that are all 60° | . It is important to note that to designate sides as equal you would use a dash, similar to how you would mark parallel lines as we noted earlier. . The angle sum of a triangle is 180°. . Angle sum of n-gon . Dr Nguyen (and Osmond Lin’s dead rabbit) wanted to find the interior angle size of a polygon, but he couldn’t remember its angle sum! Dr Nguyen (and Osmond Lin’s dead rabbit) is confuddled, but by using the below steps, he can find his interior angle size of a polygon! . Let n be the number of sides of said polygon. . 180(n - 2) = angle sum of n-gon . For example: . Where n-gon has 5 sides (pentagon). 180(5 - 2) = angle sum of pentagon = 540° . You can therefore find the size of a single interior angle from this equation . Where the angle sum of n-gon (pentagon) is 540° 540/n = single interior angle of n-gon 540/5 = 108° . Angle sums . The exterior angle theorem dictates that the exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of the two opposite interior angles. . For example: . . The angle sum of a triangle can be used to prove other theorems, for example, one which relates to the angle in a semicircle. Although this isn’t apart of the main textbook curriculum, it is located in the Enrichment section of the textbook. . Suppose a triangle, △ABC, where BC is equal to the diameter of the semicircle, then ∠C is equal to 90°. . As you may recall from Chapter 3, quadrilaterals are four-sided polygons. They include kites, trapeziums (also known as trapezoids in North America), parallelograms, rhombus, rectangles, and squares. . Every quadrilateral have two diagonals, and in some quadrilaterals the diagonals bisect each other (cut each other in half). . Quadrilaterals can be convex or non-convex. . Convex quadrilaterals all have vertices pointing outside (all exterior angles are reflex angles) | Non-convex quadrilaterals have some vertices pointing inwards (one exterior angles is not a reflex angle) | . The angle sum of a quadrilateral is 360°. . Quadrilaterals with parallel sides contain two pairs of co-interior angles. . In line and rotational symmetry, the line of symmetry divides a shape into equal parts (mirrored). . The order of rotational symmetry refers to the number of times a figure “coincides with its original position” in turning through one full rotation, according to the textbook. . A better way to put this: . In one full rotation (360° rotation) how many times does the position of the figure match the original position? . For an equilateral triangle, it is the same at the beginning of the rotation, a third of the way through, and another third of the way through, before it returns. If a figure has no rotational symmetry, its order of rotational symmetry is 1. . A polyhedron has the following properties:: . closed solid | flat surfaces | vertices and edges | named after the number of faces | . Euler’s formula dictates: . E = F + V - 2 . Where F = faces, V = vertices and E = edges. . Prisms are polyhedra. They have the following properties: . two identical/congruent ends, + an identical cross section to the ends | other faces are parallelograms | right prisms have all other faces as rectangles | named after number of parallelograms that make up the solid | . Pyramids are polyhedra with a base face, and all other faces meeting at a vertex point; the apex. They are named by the shape of the base. .

This section is more advanced. For quadratics take a look at Year 9 Maths Chapter 8 and Year 9 Maths Chapter 10 . Basic terms and information: . A number plane (or Cartesian plane) includes a y-axis and an x-axis, intersecting at right angles, forming four quadrants. | Anti-clockwise from top-right: Quadrant 1 - Quadrant 4. | Point on a number plane has coordinates: (x, y), where x is number of horizontal units from origin (x-coordinate) and vice versa (vertical units, y-coordinate). | The point (0, 0) is known as the origin. | A rule or a formula is an equation connecting two or more variables. | A straight line forms a linear rule. | Linear rules are often written with y as the subject. For example, y = 3x - 2 | . You can use a table of values to find a rule. The rule must be true for every pair of coordinates, substituted into a table or graph. . For example: . y = ☐x + ☐ . To find a rule, use the formula below. . y = mx + b . where m is the gradient and b is the y-intercept. This is known as gradient-intercept form. . The gradient is rise over run. | On a graph, it is the steepness of a line, measured by a specific height measurement, over a specific length measurement. | For example, for a gradient to be 2, on a graph the line would be increasing in height, and for every 5 units on the x axis, there would be a growth of 10 units. | In a table of values, it is the difference in the y-axis between every consecutive number on the x-axis | The y-intercept is the constant value when x = 0. | The x-intercept is the constant value where y = 0. | . . A linear equation has a solution, where a pair of values, representing x-coordinates and y-coordinates, solve an equation when substituted into their relative pronumerals. . Where there are two straight lines crossing over, there is a point of intersection (the point where the lines cross). In this case, the point of intersection is the pair of values that satisfies both rules. . . Non-linear relationships are graphs or rules that are not linear (form a curve, such as a parabola). . An example of a non-linear curve: . y = x^2 .",

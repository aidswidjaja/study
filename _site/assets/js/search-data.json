    "content": "“Haven’t we all done this in our Maths Summary Books?” . This website contains archives of Adrian’s digitised exam resources and stuff like that. Feel free to use it for your own intents and purposes. . . Historically stuff like this got hosted on Google Drive but 99 page Google Docs can get laggy very quickly. As I’m usually the only person working on my own resources, I didn’t need the system that could support editing as well, so we’re now hosting it on this nice website. . I’ve got more of where this stuff came from over on Quizlet so take a look there if there’s things missing from here, and if you’re doing the Maths 5.2 curriculum and you’d like to see what the 5.3 bois are up to, check out this Google Drive folder. That Google Drive link also contains the link to the spiritual precursor of this project, Maths and Science Study Notes. . What do you have here? . We’ve got a few things on this website including: . Study notes | Cheat sheets | Practice papers | Student-made Quizzes | . and other things that might be of interest to you. . How much have you already completed? . You can see our Roadmap which contains our schedule and projected topics. . How can I download this offline? . Please see Offline Copies for more information. . Is there more? . If you’d like to contribute, please feel free to email me and let me know what you can help out with. . Last updated: 29 September 2019 AEST .",

    "content": "Offline Copies . This guide assumes that you have a basic understanding of cd (chdir) and md (mkdir), Git, Ruby, RubyGems, and Bundler. . Some content like Cheat Sheets and Student-made Quizzes are downloadable as PDFs. . You also require the following dependencies: . RubyGems | Bundler | Git - which is preinstalled on many systems already | . If you’re on Mac, you might want to not affect the pre-installed system Ruby. You can use RVM to install multiple different versions of Ruby. You might also want to get Homebrew if you would like to make the process easier, but it isn’t neccessary. . Use a different version of Ruby (optional): rvm list # shows all installed versions rvm use x.x.x # uses version no x.x.x which ruby # confirms which Ruby version you are now using . | Clone the repository: cd DIRECTORY-NAME # replace DIRECTORY-NAME-HERE with the directory where you want to store the contents # or leave empty for user root directory # (i.e C: Users Adrian and Jacinta~/Macintosh HD/Users/Adrian are your root directories) git clone https://github.com/aidswidaja/study . | Download the theme: cd study # or replace &#39;study&#39; with the name of your directory (if you have renamed it) # if you moved your directory under another folder, cd into that first # (i.e if you moved it under Documents, cd ~/Documents/study) # (i.e or if you renamed the folder to examstuff, cd ~/Documents/examstuff) gem install just-the-docs . | View it in your web browser: jekyll serve # or bundle exec jekyll serve . then navigate to localhost:4000 in your preferred web browser. . | If you have no idea about what any of this means, please don’t try anything and email me instead. .",

    "content": "Roadmap . for Things You Should Know and Adrian’s Study Club . A majority of the project will be moving everything from Google Docs to Markdown format to host on this site. However, with finals approaching close and our lack of neccessity for Roman numerals migration to the new platform will be done from most recent to least recent. Exceptions may apply for important content. This also means that topic areas from previous years that don’t get covered now won’t be prioritised as much. . If you’d like to contribute and help out, please email me!. If your school works from a different curriculum let me know too and we can make an arrangement to mutually benefit both schools! . Be advised this roadmap also contains information for Things You Should Know and Adrian’s Study Club on Quizlet, marked with [TYSK] and [QUIZLET] respectively.

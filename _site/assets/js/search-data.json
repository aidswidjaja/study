Table of Contents . also known as Chemistry ‚Äì the inside story Table of Contents | . | Model of an atom | Electron shells Examples of electron configurations | . | Atomic numbers and mass number Atomic number | Mass number | . | . . Model of an atom . Model of an atom: . Small and dense nucleus made up of: neutrons (uncharged particles) | protons (positively charged particles) | | Surrounded by rapidly moving electrons | Held together through nuclear forces | Particles with the same charge repel each other. Particles with opposite charges are attracted to each other. . Most volume of the electron is made up of empty space. . Electrons == 1/2000th size of protons and neutrons. | Electrons have electrical charge of -1 | Protons have electrical charge of +1 | Neutrons have no electrical charge | Atoms usually have the same number of electrons as neutrons | Electrons move rapidly around the nucleus, in regions known as electron shells . | In the nucleus: protons and neutrons | Surrounding the nucleus: electrons | . The number of protons in an atom determines what type of atom it is . e.g gold atom has 79 protons . Electron shells . and the 2, 8, 18 rule . Electrons fill electron shells. The number of electrons a shell can fit increases as the shell‚Äôs distance from the nucleus increases. . The numnber of electrons a shell can hold is equal to 2n^2 where n is the shell number. . Therefore: . 2 √ó 1^2 = 2 (for shell one) 2 √ó 2^2 = 8 (for shell two) 2 √ó 3^2 = 18 (for shell three) . and so on. This is called the 2, 8, 18 rule. Electrons fill from the inner most shell going outwards. You can see a diagramatic representation on this electron dot diagram. . . Examples of electron configurations . Aluminium has 13 protons, therefore aluminium‚Äôs electron configuration is 2, 8, 3 . Sodium has 11 protons, therefore sodium‚Äôs electron configuration is 2, 8, 1 . Oxygen has 8 protons, therefore sodium‚Äôs electron configuration is 2, 6 . Atomic numbers and mass number . Atomic number . We know that the number of protons an atom has dictates what atom it is. In the periodic table, this is known as the atomic number. . Number of protons == Number of electrons == Atomic number e.g Chlorine has 17 protons therefore it&#39;s atomic number is 17 . Atoms are electrically neutral and must have the same number of electrons as protons. Otherwise, they become ions. . Mass number . Mass number == number of protons + number of neutrons . Electrons are too small to be counted. .",

    "title": "In a Nutshell: How Neurons Work Together",
    "content": "How Neurons Work Together . part of the In a Nutshell series on Adrian‚Äôs Study Club . . When a stimulus is presented, there are a number of processes that takes effect before a response is initiated. Take a humble bumblebee buzzing around. According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly. Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. However, for this example, we‚Äôll assume that the bee is in fact, flying around and being a general annoyance to someone like Barry. . Firstly, Barry‚Äôs sensory neurons (in this case, a photoreceptor) sees the bee. Barry‚Äôs photoreceptor is a part of the Peripheral Nervous System. It sees the bee and sends nerve impulses (electrical signals) which reach the brain, through interneurons. These interneurons are part of Barry‚Äôs Central Nervous System, which consists of the brain and the spinal cord. This area coordinates all of Barry‚Äôs activities and what Barry does with this information. The brain has many different types of neurons, too much for Barry to possibly comprehend! . Secondly, the sensory neurons connect to the motor neurons via interneurons. They transfer information between the sensory neurons and the motor neurons. Finally, the nerve impulse, carried over many neurotransmitters, synapses, and neurons, is brought to the motor neuron, through the spinal cord (which has a lot of nerve cells). . The motor neuron controls our muscles and organs. For Barry, it‚Äôs the motor neurons that tell his arm to swat the bee away. There are upper motor neurons that travel from the brain to the spinal cord, and the lower motor neurons which travel from the spinal cord to the muscles. . üêù . ¬© ü•úüêö .",

This section is more basic, and omits FOIL, difference of two squares, perfect squares, and more advanced concepts. . Expanding brackets allows you to look at an equation in a different way. To expand brackets, use the distributive law. . a(b + c) = a √ó b + a √ó c = ab + ac a(b + c) = a √ó b - a √ó c = ab - ac . You can express this using visual representation. . . To the contrary, you can factorise expressions to make them shorter. . Firstly, find the highest common factor (HCF), and then place that outside the brackets. Dividing each term by it, leaving the results in brackets, while using the appropriate operation. . For example, 10x + 15y has a HCF of 5, thus, in it‚Äôs factorised form, would be 5(2x + 3y). . Index notation is a convenient method of describing repeated notation. For example 165 is equal to 16 x 16 x 16 x 16 x 16 where 16 is the base and 5 is the index or exponent. . The index law for multiplying expressions which both have indexes is easy. . xm x xn = xm+n. xm / xn = xm-n. . A number raised to the power of 0 is always one.

This section is more advanced, and omits algebraic language, basic operations, distributive law, and other basic concepts. It is also suggested you read about Algebraic techniques, on page 17. . Linear equations are when the power of the pronumeral is 1 and there is only one solution. Another type of equation is the simple quadratic equation, which can be expressed as such: . x^2 = c . The power of the pronumeral is 2. Depending on the value of c, x can have zero to many solutions. . x^2 = c is a simple quadratic equation. If c &gt; 0, then your solutions are as follows: . x = ‚àöc | X= -‚àöc | . If c = 0 there is one solution, which is x = 0. . However, if c &lt; 0 then there aren‚Äôt any solutions because x^2 is always positive. . An inequality is a statement of the form: . LHS &gt; RHS - greater than - 7 &gt; 2 | LHS ‚â• RHS - greater than or equal to - 7 ‚â• 7, 7 ‚â• 2 | LHS &lt; RHS - less than - 2 &lt; 7 | LHS ‚â§ RHS - less than or equal to - 2 ‚â§ 2, 2 ‚â§ 7 | . Inequalities can be reversed, for example, x &lt; 3 and 3 &gt; x is equivalent. They can also be represented on a number line, as follows. . . As you can see, the number line is on the x axis, with an arrow above the corresponding numbers. For example, in the first example, you can see that x is larger or equal to than five. As it is inclusive of five, there is a filled circle. On the contrary, with a statement that lacks the ‚Äòor equal to‚Äô statement, it is exclusive, like in the second example, where 6 is excluded, thus the open circle. . Tl;dr: If the statement contains an ‚Äòor equal to‚Äô statement within the inequality, then the circle is open. Otherwise, it is closed. . A range can be represented as a segment on the number line. . Solving inequalities can be performed by finding an equivalent inequality to the given. . Adding or subtracting an expression from both sides | Multiplying or dividing both sides by any positive number | Multiplying or dividing both sides by a negative number AND reversing the inequality symbol | Swapping LHS and RHS and reversing the inequality symbol | . The above represent methods in which an equivalent inequality can be obtained. . . Problem solving - Two people painting a wall . You can use equations to answer a question such as the following: . Kingston prepares a rabbit for sacrifice in 8 hours. Oscar does that in 6 hours. If Kingston and Oscar worked together, how long would it take to sacrifice a rabbit? . Answer: . Kingston prepares ‚Öõ of a rabbit in 1 hour. Oscar prepares ‚Öô of a rabbit in 1 hour. ‚à¥ together, they prepare ‚Öõ + ‚Öô of a rabbit in 1 hour. ‚Öõ + ‚Öô = 3/24 + 4/24 = 7/24 of a rabbit in 1 hour . Therefore: . One sacrificed rabbit = 24/7 . Unfortunately there doesn‚Äôt seem to be one easy way to explain why we flip the fraction. You idiot its because you have to divide it by 7 hours to get 1 hour worth of rabbits . Or! . Kingston prepares 3 rabbits in 24 hours Oscar prepares 4 rabbits in 24 hours ‚à¥ together, they prepare (3 + 4) rabbits in 24 hours. 3 + 4 = 7 = 7 rabbits in 24 hours . Therefore: . One sacrifice rabbit = 24/7 .",

# Stage 4 Geography

<label class="label label-green">Complete</label>

There are not many notes for S4 Geography. You should instead refer to [BBC Bitesize GCSE Geography](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/examspecs/zyp7jty) or [Stage 5 Geography](../s5/index.html) for more.

All of these notes are archives from previous years. 

- [x] Interconnections
- [x] Landforms and Landscapes

For a good video on Interconnections, see this video I made when I was 12. It got me full marks.

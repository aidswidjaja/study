# Stage 5 Geography

#### Study Notes

- [x] The 7 Geographical Concepts
- [ ] Environmental Change and Management
- [ ] Biomes and Food Security
- [ ] Changing Places
- [ ] Migration

GeoTip: do some of the questions out of the textbook, you never know when the Geography Department gets lazy and just copies question straight out of there!

I'm also not going to finish this in time, so from Biomes and Food Security onwards everything will be significantly abbreviated.

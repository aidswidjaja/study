## Key inquiry questions

- How do environments function?
- How do people’s worldviews affect their attitudes to and use of environments?
- What are the causes and consequences of change in environments and how can this change be managed?
- Why is an understanding of environmental processes and interconnections essential for sustainable management of environments?

Outcomes and key inquiry questions are [from our friends at NESA](https://educationstandards.nsw.edu.au/wps/portal/nesa/k-10/learning-areas/hsie/geography-k-10/content/1192).

## Environment

- **Environment:** an interrelationship between living (biotic) and non-living (abiotic)
- **Ecosystem:** living organisms within a community and abiotic components of their environment

### Food chain

Food chains and food webs consist of:
- **Producers:** convert sunlight into food (photosynthesis) – plants
- **Consumers:** eat other annimals or plants – animals

### Scale in the environment

Revise on scale on [The 7 Geographical Concepts](concepts.html#scale).

1. Individual organism
2. Population – groups of plants or animals of the same species in one particular area
3. Community - populations of different species interact with each other
4. Ecosystem - interaction between communinty and its abiotic habitat
5. Biome - defined by similar landscapes (climate, vegetation)

Habitats are preferred locations of organisms because it has the resources the organism needs to survive and thrive, such as water, temperature, minerals, sunlight, and other features.

### Australia's biomes

![Climate Classification of Australia - BoM](http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/how/newproducts/images/kpn_map.jpg)

A vast majority of Australia is desert. Southeastern Australia (Tasmania, coastal Victoria, coastal NSW, Adelaide) is temperate and northern Australia is tropical/subtropical. Quensland tends to be less tropical than more northern parts such as Cape York and Darwin.

#### Water cycle

```
Evaporation –> condensation –> precipitation –> collection
```

#### Carbon cycle
[Carbon Cycle on Earth Observatory](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features/CarbonCycle){: .btn .btn-blue}

There are two carbon cycles: long term (geological) and short term (biological/physical).

###### Geological - long term
- Occurs over hundreds of millions of years
- Buildup of carbon in rocks/fossil fuels
- Moves between rocks, soil, ocean and atmosphere using chemical reactions and tectonic activity

```
1. Atmosphereic carbon + water –> carbonic acid
2. Atmosphere (carbonic acid in rain) –> Lithosphere (acid dissolves rocks)
3. Calcium, magnesium, potassium, or sodium ions released
4. Rvier carries ions to ocean
```

###### Biological/Physical - short term
- Occurs over days/weeks/months/years
- Cycling of carbon through photosynthesis and cellular metabolism

Carbon flows between atmosphere, land and atmopshere. 

![Carbon cycle](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/ContentFeature/CarbonCycle/images/carbon_cycle.jpg)

```
1. Carbon dioxide + water + energy –> sugar + oxygen (plants/phytoplanton photosynthesis)
2. Either
    a) Plants break down sugars for energy
    b) Animals eat plants/phytoplankton and break down sugars for energy
    c) Plants/plankton die
    d) Fire consumes plants *RIP*
3. Sugar + oxygen –> water + carbon dioxide + energy
4. Carbon ends up in the atmosphere again
```

In winter when less plants are growing and more plants are dying then carbon dioxide concentrations increase.

#### Oxygen cycle

Oxygen exists as oxygen gas (O₂) and ozone (O₃) as well as in compounds such as water (H₂O) and carbon dioxide (CO₂). 

![Global Oxygen (O2) Cycle](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7b/Global_Oxygen_Cycle.jpg)

In the biosphere (worldwide sum of all ecosystems):
- Oxygen is released by photosynthesis
- Oxygen is absorbed by respiration (breathing organisms)

In the atmosphere:
- Oxygen is formed through UV light: `water –> oxygen + hydrogen` – this process is photolysis
- Oxygen is removed from the atmosphere through respiration (decay of organisms and weathering of rocks)

### Ecosystem Services

Ecosystem services provide clean air, plant pollination and fertile soil. However, this is being threatened by human activity (e.g climate change). Ecosystem services are classified according to their products and functions.

### Source
Natural products that are converted for use by humans (e.g coal)

### Sinks
Natural processes that absorb waste (bacteria in the soil breaking down human waste)

### Services
Natural environment that don't produce consumeable resources (e.g forests absorbing carbon dioxide and producing oxygen)

### Spirituality
Providing spiritual experiences (e.g Aboriginal connection with land)

***

## Sustainability challenges

Sustainability is the ongoing capacity of the environment to support the lives of organisms. Using resources sustainably reduces the impacts humans have on the natural environment. 

#### Fishing case study
Fish are a vital food source (15% of animal protein eaten by 3 billion people daily) and employment source (540 million people in fishing and aquaculure). However, fish levels are in serious decline and most fishing is unsustainable. Many species will not be able o recover. Fishing management is now occuring but it may be too late.

### Worldviews
We all live in one world but we can differing views of varying degrees. Usually, we are either human-centric or earth-centric. The New Ecological Paradigm is an example of a measure of worldview.

### Biodiversity
Biodiversity refers to the variety of living organisms on the planet. It is measured by number of species present in a particular ecosystem/region. 

### Biodiversity under threat

The loss of biodiversity impacts ecosystem services. Loss of biodiversity is caused by human activity:

- habitat change (e.g deforestation)
- overexploitation of resources (e.g fresh air)
- pollution (land, air, water)
- invasive species
- climate change

36% of species are threatened with extinction.

#### Case study: frogs

- Frog species numbers are in dramatic decline due to climate change
- Frogs are losing water through skin due to warmer climates
- Also they are losing breeding grounds
- The greatest threat is disease, as an African parasitic fungus (amphibian chytrid) is spreading and warmer temperatures is only helping

## Climate change

Greenhouses gases such as carbon dioxide (caused by fossil fuel burning), methane (caused by livestock farming), nitrous oxide (caused by fertiliser) and flourinated gases (from fridges) is contributing to global warming. As a result, species and ecosystem services can be threatened. This is becasue climate change alters the conditions in which ecosystems develop, flourish, or decay.

## Pollution

Pollution is any substance released into the environment that has harmful or poisnonus effects. They can impact the ability of the natural environment to provide ecosystem services.

### Air pollution

Air polution is the contamination of the atmosphere, usually through the release of harmful gases. It can be local (e.g factory and smokestacks) but can also be large-scale pollution (e.g cities) that affect large areas

### Water pollution

Water pollution is the contamination of water sources (rivers, lakes, oceans, etc) through the release of harmful substances. It can be caused by human activities near water (e.g shipping, oil drilling) or land acivities (littering, land clearing).

### Land pollution

Land pollution is the contamination of land areas through the release of harmful substances. On a local scale, pollution can occur in forms such as soil contamination (e.g old petrol station sites) or on larger scales (e.g increasing salinity in the Murray-Darling Basin). 

***

### Land changes caused by human activity

Loss of productivity and decline in fertitlty due to human activities is called **land degradation**. It contributes to climate change and there are three types of land degradation.

1. Soil degradation
- Loss of soil fertility
- Often caused by:
    * large machinery/animals compacting soil
    * becoming acidic
    * loss of nutrients
- Examples include salinity (buildup of salt)

2. Soil erosion
- Soil gradually worn away
- Often caused by deforestation (as cleared land is more vulnerable to erosion than land with plants)

3. Ecosystem decline
- Natural ecosystems become degraded through:
    - loss of vegetation
    - invasive species
    - decline in water quality
- Can lead to desertification - process of which become fertile land becomes desert

### Soil degradation – salinity

Salt is a natural part of the environment. However, when the water table rises then more salt is brought up to the surface, which kills plants and turns freshwater into salt water.

Sometimes, irrigation can cause increased salinity as it increases the amount of water in the soil.

***

## Ecosystem decline

### Deforestation
- Land clearing occurs to provide for farmland
- Ecosystem services don't have economic values so aren't as valued as much
- As a result less oxygen is produced and natural habitats are threatened

### Invasive species
- Groups of species that have been introduced in areas they are not native to are called invasive species
- Ecosystems around the world can be threatened by invasive species
- Sometimes invasive species are introduced deliberately, othertimes they are unintentional
- Invasive species can disrupt the balance of the eocsystem, degrade the land, and impact local populations

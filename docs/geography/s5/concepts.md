There are 7 geographical concepts as defined by the K-10 Geographical Concepts Continuum. Based off Geographical Concepts on NESA K-10 Key Learning Areas.

## Place

> **THE CONCEPT OF PLACE IS ABOUT THE SIGNIFICANCE OF PLACES AND WHAT THEY ARE LIKE**

* Places can be parts of the Earth's surface with different identities
* They can be described by location, shape, boundaries, features, environmental, and human characteristics
* Place is influenced by environmental characteristics and resources, relative location, interconnections, culture, economy, and decisions and actions made regarding place over time
* Characteristics of place can be tangible...
    * landforms
    * people
* or intangible
    * scenic quality
    * culture
* Environmental characteristics of place are influenced by human and environmental processes
* Sustainability of places can be threatened by...
    * natural hazards;
    * climate change;
    * economic, social and technological change;
    * government decisions and politics; and
    * resource exhaution.

## Space

> **THE CONCEPT OF SPACE IS ABOUT THE SIGNIFICANCE OF LOCATION AND SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION, AND WAYS PEOPLE ORGANISE AND MANAGE THE SPACES THAT WE LIVE IN**

* Environmental and human characetristics of places can be influenced by their location
* The effects of location and distance can be reduced (potentially unequally) through transport and communication technologies
* Individual characteristics of places form **spatial distributions**
* Distributions can have environmental, economic, social and political consequences
* Spaces can be
    * perceived;
    * structured;
    * organised; and
    * managed by people
* They can be modified to achieve or fit a particular purpose(s)

## Environment

> **THE CONCEPT OF ENVIRONMENT IS ABOUT THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE ENVIRONMENT IN HUMAN LIFE, AND THE IMPORTANT INTERRELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN HUMANS AND THE ENVIORNMENT**

* The environment is the product of:
    * geological (relating to the earth's physical structure);
    * atmospheric (rtt. atmosphere of the earth);
    * hydrological (rtt. properties, distribution and circulation of water);
    * geomorphic (rtt. form of the landscape and other natural features of the earth);
    * edaphic (rtt. soil);
    * biotic (living/biological) and abiotic (physical); and
    * human processes.
* The environment **supports and enriches** life by:
    * providing raw materials and food;
    * absorbing and recycling wastes;
    * maintaining a safe habitat; and
    * being a source of enjoyment and inspiration
* Concepts that influence how people perceive, adapt to and use environments
    * Culture
    * Population density
    * Economy
    * Technology
    * Values
    * Environmental worldviews
* Human-induced environmental change (and management, thereof), including cause and effect, consequences of change, and application of geographical concepts and techniques in order to identify appropriate strategies
* The impacts of specific hazards in different environments can be determined by **natural and human factors**
* Hazards can be managed through prevention, mitigation, and preparedness

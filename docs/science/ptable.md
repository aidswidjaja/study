The vertical columns are called [Groups](/science/s5/chem1.html#groups-in-the-periodic-table). All elements in a group (column) have the same number of valence electrons.

The horizontal rows are called Periods. All elements in a period (row) have the same number of electron shells.

Enable Electrons in the upper right hand corner to see the electron configuration.

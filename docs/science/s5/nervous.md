*Hey there! Please be advised if you're an* <label class="label label-blue">Aloys</label> *boi this doesn't exactly match your textbook! I've tried to keep similar concepts together so if you can't find something, feel free to use the textbook, or use that neat little search bar up the top there! Thanks!*

## The Nervous System

The nervous system controls and coordinates your body. It is divided into two parts:
- Central nervous system (brain and spinal cord)
- Peripheral nervous system (nerves that connect the CNS to the rest of the body)

### Stimulus, Receptor, Response!

The first step to initiating a response is having a stimulus.

A stimulus can be anything which triggers an action, including:
- Seeing a chainsaw thrown at you by Oscar
- Hearing the teacher coming towards you while you're playing video games in class
- Seeing a freezer full of chocolate 

This stimulus is received by a receptors. Examples of receptors include:
**Type of receptor**|**Stimulus these receptors respond to**|**Example of places where these are found**
:-----:|:-----:|:-----:
Chemoreceptors|Chemicals|Tongue
Photoreceptors|Light|Eye
Mechanoreceptors|Pressure or distortion|Skin, inner ear
Thermoreceptors|Heat|Skin

Different types of receptor cells do different things. Let's look at the eye now!

## The Structure of the Eye
**This section is basically ripped off the textbook.**

The eye is made up of a number of different components.

![Structure of the Eye](http://content.jacplus.com.au/secure/ebooks/07303/0730354067/images/01.03.04.png)

- The cornea is the clear, curved, outer surface of the eye
    - It is curved so light approaching the eye is refracted towards the pupil
- The lens is a clear, flexible tissue located behind the iris and the pupil
    - It focuses light onto the retina
- The retina is a curved surface at the very back of the eye, which is lined with photoreceptors. The photoreceptors respond to light by sending signals to the optic nerve, which in turn sends signals to the brain in the CNS

- Short sightedness and long-sightedness occurs when light doesn't focus on the retina properly

## The Structure of the Neuron

A neuron is a long cell containing:
- a cell body and a nucleus which supplies energy and nutrients to the neuron
- dendrites which are branches that receive nerve impulses from receptors and other receptors
- axons which are long structures that nerve impulses pass along. Electrical signals travelling along are insulated by myelin
- axon branches at the end of each axon that send nerve impulses to other neurons or effectors

Direction of travel:
```
Dendrite ––––––––––––––––> Axon Branch
```

There are two neuron structures.

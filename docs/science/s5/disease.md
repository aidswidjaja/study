## I like infecting others

Disease can be sorted into two categories:
- Infectious - caused by pathogens (e.g bacteria, viruses, fungi) and are contagious
- Non-infectious - no pathogens and non-contagious

### Infectious diseases

Pathogens are parasites that live in or on other organisms (the host) and have a harmful effect on their host. What bad guests! They can either me microscopic (invisible to the naked eye) or macroscopic (visible to the naked eye). Meet *the pAtHoGeNs!*

**Type of pathogen**|**Description**|**Typical size**|**Example of disease**
:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:
Bacteria|Single celled organisms with DNA outside of the nucleus|0.2-5μm|Leprosy, throat infections, scarlet fever, HIV
Viruses|DNA or RNA wrapped in protein, requires a host to reproduce|20-300nm|AIDS, influenza, hepatitis, measles, salmonella
Protozoa|Single celled organisms with DNA inside the nucleus|2-200μm|Malaria, cryptospordium
Fungi|One or more cells with cell walls and a nucleus, but no chloroplast|50μm –> much larger|Ringworm, athlete's foot

Transmission can occur through direct contact, water, air, food, or other organisms (vectors). The table from BBC Bitesize below outlines some examples.

**Type**|**Examples**
:-----:|:-----:
Direct contact|This can be sexual contact during intercourse or non-sexual contact, like shaking hands.
Water|Dirty water can transmit many diseases, such as the cholera bacterium.
Air|When a person who is infected by the common cold sneezes, they can spray thousands of tiny droplets containing virus particles to infect others.
Unhygienic food preparation|Undercooked or reheated food can cause bacterial diseases like Escherichia coli which is a cause of food poisoning.
Vector|Any organism that can spread a disease is called a vector. Many farmers think tuberculosis in their cattle can be spread by badgers.

There are also macroparasites and prions but this isn't important for now.

### Non-infectious diseases

**Type of disease**|**Description**
:-----:|:-----:
Nutrition|Overeating, undereating, unbalanced diet
Ageing|Gradual breakdown of body tissues
Cancer|Multiplication of body cells at an abnormal rate
Inherited disorders|Passed on from family genes
Mental disorders|Caused by chemical deficiencies, strees, trauma
Metabolic disorders|Caused by chemical deficiencies
Environmental disorders|Exposure to poisons, asbestos, fire, drugs, pollution

Most people die from lifestyle diseases such as cardiovascular diseases (stroke, heart attack) which is caused by obesity and lack of nutritione/exercise or lung cancer as a result of smoking.

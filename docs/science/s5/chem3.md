## Primers

### Polyatomic ion valencies you need to remember

| **Valency** | **Ion**   | **Formula** |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| `1+`          | Ammonium  | NH₄         |
| `1-`          | Hydroxide | OH          |
| `1-`          | Nitrate   | NO₃         |
| `2-`          | Carbonate | CO₃         |
| `2-`          | Sulfate   | SO₄         |
| `3-`          | Phosphate | PO₄         |

Remember! All transition metals have a valency of `2+` except for Gold, which has a valency of `1+`

### Endothermic and exothermic reactions

- Endothermic reactions **absorb** heat
  - respiration
  - metal + acid
  - heat packs and warmers
- Exothermic reactions **release** heat
  - photosynthesis
  - ice packs

> TIP! To remember the difference between **endo**thermic and **exo**thermic reactions - remember that **endo** sounds like **in**hale (take in), and **exo** sounds like **ex**hale (release) with respect to __heat__.

### Hydrocarbons

Hydrocarbons are compounds made up of only hydrogen and carbon.

**Molecular Formula **|**Name**
:-----:|:-----:
CH4 |methane
C2H6 |ethane
C4H8 |buthane
C3H8 |propane
C4H10 |butane
C5H12 |pentane
C6H14 |hexane
C7H16 |heptane
C8H18 |octane
C9H20 |nonane
C10H22 |decane

- Your standard hydrocarbons are known as **alkanes** (methane `CH4`, ethane `C2H6`, buthane `C4H8`, etc) - they are saturated and are joined by single bonds.
    - They are relatively unreactive apart from combustion reactions
- **Alkanels** or ***alcohols** (methanol `CH3OH`, ethanol `C2H5OH`, butanol `C4H7OH`, etc) contain saturated hybocarbons bound to a hydroxide `-OH` . 

### Reactivity series

![https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Tq1XUPWeAZ8/VOFc1B9C6jI/AAAAAAAAA2U/Jv4oPX0EpuE/s1600/3.3.1.png]

Metals that are higher up the reactivity series are more reactive and more vulnerable to reactions such as corrosion.

## Precipitation reactions
### When solutions of different ionic compounds react with each other, they sometimes produce a **precipitate** - insoluble solid. 
{: .no_toc }


For example:
```nimrod
silver nitrate + sodium chloride solution -> sodium nitrate + silver chloride (precipitate)
```

Precipitation reactions are predicted using a __table of solubilities__. 

|Anion|All soluble/insoluble|except|(slightly)|
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
|Chlorides `Cl-`|all soluble except |`Ag+` • `Hg₂2+`|`Pb2+` 
|Bromides `Br-`|all soluble except|`Ag+` • `Hg₂2+` • `Hg2+`|`Pb2+`|
|Iodides `I-`|all soluble except|`Ag+` • `Hg₂2+` • `Hg2+` • `Pb2+`  |    |
|Nitrates `NO₃-`|all soluble, no exceptions|    |    |
|Sulfates `SO₄2-`|all soluble except|`Sr2+` • `Ba2+` • `Hg₂2+` • `Hg2+`   |`Ca2+` • `Ag+`|
|Phosphates `PO₄3-`|all insoluble except|`Na+` • `K+` • `Rb+` • `Cs+` • `NH₄`|    |
|Carbonates `CO₃2-`|all insoluble except|`Na+` • `K+` • `Rb+` • `Cs+` • `NH₄`||
|Hydroxides `OH-`|all insoluble except|  `Li+` • `Na+` • `K+` • `Rb+` • `Cs+` • `Ba2+` • `NH₄`|`Ca2+` • `Sr2+`|

Cool tip! Given two ionic compounds (solutions) swap the metals OR swap the ions. For example, given:

```nimrod
sodium hydroxide + lead nitrate
# swap the metals (or gases) around!

-> lead hydroxide + sodium nitrate
```

Sometimes there will be no precipitate formed. Therefore, check your table of solubilities to see whether a precipitate can be formed.

## Combustion reactions
### Combustion reactions occur when oxygen reacts with another substance to produce energy in the form of heat, light and sound.

<span class="fs-4">[Alkanes and alkenes on BBC Bitesize (GCSE)](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/z3mpk7h/revision/1){: .btn .btn-green}</span>

A combustion reaction is an exothermic reaction as it releases heat, and it often involves hydrocarbons.

#### Complete combustion

In complete combustion all reactants will combust provided sufficient oxygen is available. Carbon oxidises to carbon dioxide, and hydrogen oxides to water.

> Remember! Oxidation is the process of gaining oxygen.

The general equation for complete combustion is:
```nimrod
hydrocarbon + oxygen -> carbon dioxide + water
```

For example, in methane:
```nimrod
methane + oxygen -> carbon dioxide + water
  CH4   +   O    ->      CO2       + H2O
```

Simples!

#### Incomplete combustion

When there isn't enough oxygen to allow for a complete combustion reaction, incomplete combustion occurs instead.

The general equation for incomplete combustion is:
```nimrod
hydrocarbon + oxygen -> carbon monoxide + carbon + water 
```

For example, in methane (balanced chemical eq.):
```nimrod
methane + oxygen -> carbon monoxide + carbon + water
   4CH4 +  5O2   ->       2CO       +   2C   + 8H2O
```

Note that `carbon dioxide` has been replaced with `carbon monoxide + carbon`

- Carbon monoxide is poisonous!
- Carbon is produced in the form of soot.

**It was determined in an experiment that less energy is released with less carbon atoms.**

## Corrosion
### Corrosion occurs when metal is exposed to air, water or other substances.
{: .no_toc }

<span class="fs-4">[Corrosion on BBC Bitesize (National 4)](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/zjb2pv4/revision/2){: .btn .btn-green}</span>

Some materials are more vulnerable to corrosion than others
- Iron and steel rust
- Tin doesn't rust

In the real world (yea with all this coronavirus stuff I guess noone knows what that is anymore eh) corrosion is prevented through different measures:

- Painting/greasing: Paint or grease protects the metal from air, water, and sunlight.
- Electro-plating: tin-plated iron won't rust as the iron is not exposed, and tin doesn't rust. Electro-plating involves covering a metal in a thin layer of a less reactive metal.
- Sacrificial Protection: Magnesium is more reactive in corrosion, therefore it can be sacrificed instead of the material under it. Sacrificial protection involves coating a metal in a more reactive metal.
- Galvanising is similar to sacrificial protection, but it specifically refers to coating iron or steel with a zinc protective layer.

## Displacement reaction 
### In a displacement reaction, a more reactive metal will displace a less reactive metal from its compounds[^1]

<span class="fs-4">[Displacement reactions on BBC Bitesize (KS3)](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/zqwmxnb/revision/3){: .btn .btn-green}</span>

![https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Tq1XUPWeAZ8/VOFc1B9C6jI/AAAAAAAAA2U/Jv4oPX0EpuE/s1600/3.3.1.png]

Some metals are more reactive than others.

```nimrod
Fe + Pb(NO₃)₂ -> Fe(NO₃)₂ + Pb  # displacement has occured
Mg + CuSO     -> MgSO₄ + Cu     # displacement has occured
Pb + Fe(NO₃)₂ -> NO REACTION    # no displacement
Au + Pb(NO₃)₂ -> NO REACTION    # no displacement
```

According to the Reactivity series, Magnesium is more reactive than zinc, and zinc is more reactive than iron, and iron is more reactive than copper, etc. This is best represented in this table displaying different reactions and whether an observable and visible reaction occurs.

| |**Magnesium**|**Zinc**|**Iron**|**Copper**
:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:
Magnesium sulfate|✘|✘|✘|✘
Zinc sulfate|✔|✘|✘|✘
Iron sulfate|✔|✔|✘|✘

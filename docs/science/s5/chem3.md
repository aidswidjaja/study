## Primers

### Polyatomic ion valencies you need to remember

| **Valency** | **Ion**   | **Formula** |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| `1+`          | Ammonium  | NH₄         |
| `1-`          | Hydroxide | OH          |
| `1-`          | Nitrate   | NO₃         |
| `2-`          | Carbonate | CO₃         |
| `2-`          | Sulfate   | SO₄         |
| `3-`          | Phosphate | PO₄         |

Remember! All transition metals have a valency of `2+` except for Gold, which has a valency of `1+`

### Endothermic and exothermic reactions

- Endothermic reactions **absorb** heat
- Exothermic reactions **release** heat

> TIP! To remember the difference between **endo**thermic and **exo**thermic reactions - remember that **endo** sounds like **in**hale (take in), and **exo** sounds like **ex**hale (release) with respect to __heat__.

### Hydrocarbons

Hydrocarbons are compounds made up of only hydrogen and carbon.

**Molecular Formula **|**Name**
:-----:|:-----:
CH4 |methane
C2H6 |ethane
C4H8 |buthane
C3H8 |propane
C4H10 |butane
C5H12 |pentane
C6H14 |hexane
C7H16 |heptane
C8H18 |octane
C9H20 |nonane
C10H22 |decane

- Your standard hydrocarbons are known as **alkanes** (methane `CH4`, ethane `C2H6`, buthane `C4H8`, etc) - they are saturated and are joined by single bonds.
    - They are relatively unreactive apart from combustion reactions
- **Alkanels** or ***alcohols** (methanol `CH3OH`, ethanol `C2H5OH`, butanol `C4H7OH`, etc) contain saturated hybocarbons bound to a hydroxide `-OH` . 

## Precipitation reactions
### When solutions of different ionic compounds react with each other, they sometimes produce a **precipitate** - insoluble solid. 
{: .no_toc }


For example:
```nimrod
silver nitrate + sodium chloride solution -> sodium nitrate + silver chloride (precipitate)
```

Precipitation reactions are predicted using a __table of solubilities__. 

|Anion|All soluble/insoluble|except|(slightly)|
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
|Chlorides `Cl-`|all soluble except |`Ag+` • `Hg₂2+`|`Pb2+` 
|Bromides `Br-`|all soluble except|`Ag+` • `Hg₂2+` • `Hg2+`|`Pb2+`|
|Iodides `I-`|all soluble except|`Ag+` • `Hg₂2+` • `Hg2+` • `Pb2+`  |    |
|Nitrates `NO₃-`|all soluble, no exceptions|    |    |
|Sulfates `SO₄2-`|all soluble except|`Sr2+` • `Ba2+` • `Hg₂2+` • `Hg2+`   |`Ca2+` • `Ag+`|
|Phosphates `PO₄3-`|all insoluble except|`Na+` • `K+` • `Rb+` • `Cs+` • `NH₄`|    |
|Carbonates `CO₃2-`|all insoluble except|`Na+` • `K+` • `Rb+` • `Cs+` • `NH₄`||
|Hydroxides `OH-`|all insoluble except|  `Li+` • `Na+` • `K+` • `Rb+` • `Cs+` • `Ba2+` • `NH₄`|`Ca2+` • `Sr2+`|

Cool tip! Given two ionic compounds (solutions) swap the metals OR swap the ions. For example, given:

```nimrod
sodium hydroxide + lead nitrate
# swap the metals (or gases) around!

-> lead hydroxide + sodium nitrate
```

Sometimes there will be no precipitate formed. Therefore, check your table of solubilities to see whether a precipitate can be formed.

## Combustion reactions
### Combustion reactions occur when oxygen reacts with another substance to produce energy in the form of heat, light and sound.

A combustion reaction is an exothermic reaction as it releases heat, and it often involves hydrocarbons.

#### Complete combustion

In complete combustion all reactants will combust provided sufficient oxygen is available. Carbon oxidises to carbon dioxide, and hydrogen oxides to water.

> Remember! Oxidation is the process of gaining oxygen.

The general equation for complete combustion is:
```nimrod
hydrocarbon + oxygen -> carbon dioxide + water
```

For example, in methane:
```nimrod
methane + oxygen -> carbon dioxide + water
  CH4   +   O    ->      CO2       + H2O
```

Simples!

#### Incomplete combustion

When there isn't enough oxygen to allow for a complete combustion reaction, incomplete combustion occurs instead.

The general equation for incomplete combustion is:
```nimrod
hydrocarbon + oxygen -> carbon monoxide + carbon + water 
```

For example, in methane (balanced chemical eq.):
```nimrod
methane + oxygen -> carbon monoxide + carbon + water
   4CH4 +  5O2   ->       2CO       +   2C   + 8H2O
```

Note that `carbon dioxide` has been replaced with `carbon monoxide + carbon`

- Carbon monoxide is poisonous!
- Carbon is produced in the form of soot.

**It was determined in an experiment that less energy is released with less carbon atoms.**

## DNA structure

### Nucleotides

Nucleotides are the basic building blocks of DNA. For the scope of our subject, they're also known as **bases**.

There are four bases:
1. **A**denine
2. **T**hymine
3. **G**uanine
4. **C**ytosine

Adenine can only go with Thymine, and Guanine can only go with Cytosine. They are bonded together through hydrogen bonds. Remember it like this:

> Apples in the Tree. Cars in the Garage.

That's base pairing for ya!

SATC unit circle? **NO**. ATGC double helix structure. **hell yea**

### Sugar phosphate backbone

*Note: do not inject your backbone with sugar and phosphate.*

The sugar phosphate backbones are the strong bonds between one nucleotide and the phosphate of the next nucleotide. In the double helix structure, they form those long curly strands that are connected to each other by bases.

### Double helix model

DNA has a molecular structure of a double helix. It looks like this: 

![Double helix structure](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/14/Double_stranded_DNA_with_coloured_bases.png/1920px-Double_stranded_DNA_with_coloured_bases.png)

Well actually it looks a bit more complicated...

Yea...

Anyway, the double helix structure of DNA consists of the following components.

1. Base pairing - those are your horizontal lines which link...
2. DNA strands!

In DNA there are two **antiparallel** strands, which are basically just sugar phosphate molecules.

### Exact replication of DNA

DNA replication is extremely important, as it is the process by which genetic information is duplicated to produce new cells. Reproduction of cells, and by extension, organisms, depend on accurate and exact DNA replication. When errors or abnormalities occur in DNA replication, genetic disorders can cause developmental, intellectual, physical, or other life-threatening issues.

### Relationship between DNA, genes and chromosomes

- **DNA** molecules contain genetic information and are known for their double helix structure. 
- **Genes** are made up of DNA and contain genetic code to form **proteins**.
- **Chromosomes** are DNA molecules containing tightly coiled DNA that is only visible during cell division. It contains a very long strand of DNA, and contains many genes!

### Genes and proteins

- Genes contain the genetic code to form proteins.
- Genes become proteins through a complicated process featuring two ideas - transcription and translation.
- In accordance with the unwritten laws of standardised testing in education, we're not going to go into that since its not covered in the test.

## Cell Division

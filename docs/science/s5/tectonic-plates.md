## The Earth, in a nutshell
{: .no_toc }

![The Earth in a nutshell](https://bam.files.bbci.co.uk/bam/live/content/zfpy3k7/medium)

Earth is made up of tectonic plates; plates of crust that float on the mantle. Here’s a table of the different parts of the Earth.

| Part of the Earth | Description            |
|-------------------|------------------------|
| Crust             | Thin and rocky         |
| Mantle            | Semi-molten rock       |
| Outer Core        | Liquid nickel and iron |
| Inner Core        | Solid nickel and iron  |

Sometimes we refer to them in regions.

| Part of the Earth | Description                       |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Lithosphere       | Made up of crust and upper mantle |
| Aesthenosphere    | Below the lithosphere             |

Earth's crust is a thin and rocky section of the Earth that is about 8km thick. It floats on top of semi-molten rock in the mantle, which in turn floats on nickel and iron. 

## Wegener's Theory of Continental Drift

Alfred Wegener theorised that the Earth’s crust was made up of plates that were floating on denser magma. This was called the theory of **continental drift**. Today, the theory of tectonic plates succeeds continental drift theory. He also theorised that the continents of the world used to be one gigantic supercontinent, which he named Pangea. There were a number of different supercontinents as land broke away and joined together repeatedly.

### Evidence for the theory of continental drift

Evidence for this includes:

1. The east coast of South America and the west coast of South America match up together

2. There are similar patterns for rocks on different continents (e.g the Appalachian Mountains in North America seem to continue into the Caledonian Mountains in Scandinavia)

3. Similar fossils have been found on different continents, for example, fossils of the Mesosaurus have been found in both in both South Africa and Brazil. Cold areas such as Greenland have tropical fossils, and South Africa has ice scratches on rocks despite it's warm climate.

4. There are coal deposits in cold parts of the world (such as Antarctica) and glacial deposits in hot parts of the world (such as South Africa, Australia, South America and India) which seems to suggest that these landmasses were once joined together.

5. Tectonic and seismic activity seems to concentrate on the boundaries of the plates, known as the Ring of Fire.

Tectonic activity is the reason that our natural terrain is extremely varied. The Mid-Ocean Ridge and Marianas Trench are some examples of terrain formed by a divergent boundary and a convergent boundary respectively. The San Andreas Fault in California is a good example of a transform boundary.

### How do plates move?

Plates move in three primary ways[^1].

1. ### Divergent Boundaries
    Divergent boundaries are when two plates separate and move away from each other.

2. ### Convergent Boundaries
    Convergent boundaries are when two plates move towards each other, forcing one plate to dive beneath the other. This process is known as **subduction**.
    ![Convergent boundary](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f2/Oceanic-continental_destructive_plate_boundary.svg/1200px-Oceanic-continental_destructive_plate_boundary.svg.png)

3. ### Transform Boundaries
    Transform boundaries are when two plates slide past each other, causing a fault. A good example of a transform boundary is the San Andreas Fault in California, United States.

## Why do plates move?

Plates move because of convection currents in the molten liquid rock in the mantle. 

![Convection currents in the asthenosphere](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/Oceanic_spreading.svg/1200px-Oceanic_spreading.svg.png)

Heat generated from the really hot outer core rises, and when it gets to the top, is blocked by the crust, spreads out at the top, and falls when it begins to cool. This moves the boundaries of the plates. Gravity from the Sun and the Moon also has an effect on how plates move.

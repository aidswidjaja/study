## Endocrine system

[Human endocrine system on BBC Bitesize](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/z8t47p3/revision/1){: .btn .btn-blue}

Hormones are produced by glands in the endocrine system, and carried in the bloodstream. Hormones alter activity of target organs (organs with receptor molecules on cell surfaces that recognise a specific hormone). They differ from the nervous system as effects are slower but longer lasting.

For example, adrenaline produced in the adrenal glands target several organs in the respiratory and circulatory system. This is the 'fight or flight' reflex that can increase breathing and heart rate, and convert glycogen to glucose.

**When conditions are constant and carefully controlled, we call this homeostasis**. For example body temperature, blood glucose levels and pH levels remain relatively stable.

### Insulin

Insulin is produced in the pancreas. Insulin is then carried through the bloodstream to the liver to regulate glucose levels in the blood. This then causes conversion of glucose into glycogen (for storage). Remember that glucose = sugar.

### Thyroid

The thyroid gland produces thyroxine which regulates metabolism, heartbeat and body temperature. If there is too much thyroxine then body temperature rises. 

### Negative Feedback Loop

A negative feedback loop is a mechanism to lower raised levels of something, and then to raise reduced levels of something, continuously. 

Negative feedback is when a change in the body is detected, a message is sent to a gland or organ, and a response is initiated.

Positive feedback, however, is when a change in the normal state is amplified. For example, when the brain is stimulated to create more oxytocin (for example during labour), it induces contractions which in turn release postaglandins. And then, more oxytocin is released. Stretch receptors no longer fire once the baby is out of the womb, and no more oxytocin levels are produced.

- A	Air temperature increases.
- B	Heat receptors detect increase in temperature and send message to the hypothalamus in the brain. Message travels along nerve cells.
- C	Hypothalamus sends messages to sweat glands and walls of capillaries close to the skin.
- D	Capillaries close to the skin dilate and heat radiates from the skin surface.
- E	Sweat production increases. Heat is lost as sweat evaporates from the skin.
- F	Temperature returns to normal. Messages from hypothalamus cease and cooling responses are turned off.
- G	Air temperature decreases.
- H	Heat receptors detect decrease in temperature and send message to the hypothalamus in the brain. Message travels along nerve cells.
- Iâ€‰Hypothalamus sends messages to muscles and walls of capillaries close to the skin.
- J	Capillaries close to skin contract. Less heat radiates from skin.
- K	Muscles shiver, generating heat.
- L	Temperature returns to normal. Messages from hypothalamus cease and warming responses are turned off.

## Where are the glands in the Endocrine system located?

The endocrine system consists of a number of different glands.

## Endocrine system

[Human endocrine system on BBC Bitesize](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/z8t47p3/revision/1){: .btn .btn-blue}

Hormones are produced by glands in the endocrine system, and carried in the bloodstream. Hormones alter activity of target organs (organs with receptor molecules on cell surfaces that recognise a specific hormone). They differ from the nervous system as effects are slower but longer lasting.

For example, adrenaline produced in the adrenal glands target several organs in the respiratory and circulatory system. This is the 'fight or flight' reflex that can increase breathing and heart rate, and convert glycogen to glucose.

### Insulin

Insulin is produced in the pancreas. Insulin is then carried through the bloodstream to the liver to regulate glucose levels in the blood. This then causes conversion of glucose into glycogen (for storage). Remember that glucose = sugar.

### Thyroid

The thyroid gland produces thyroxine which regulates metabolism, heartbeat and body temperature. If there is too much thyroxine then body temperature rises. 

### Negative Feedback Loop

A negative feedback loop is a mechanism to lower raised levels of something, and then to raise reduced levels of something, continuously.

## Where are the glands in the Endocrine system located?

The endocrine system consists of a number of different glands.

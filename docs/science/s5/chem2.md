Acids are corrosive. They taste sour, and can be used to react with other substances.

Acids are chemicals with a **pH < 7**.

### Bases

Bases are sometimes corrosive. They are bitter, slippery, and/or soapy. Bases that can be dissolved in water are called **alkalis**.

Bases are chemicals with a **ph > 7**.

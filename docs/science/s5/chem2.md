## Common properties

### Acids

Acids are corrosive. They taste sour, and can be used to react with other substances.

Acids are chemicals with a **pH < 7**. Acids contain hydrogen ions (H⁺). When acids are diluted the concentration of H⁺ ions and pH increases towards 7 (neutral pH)

### Bases[^1]

Bases are sometimes corrosive. They are bitter, slippery, and/or soapy. Bases that can be dissolved in water are called **alkalis**.

Bases are chemicals with a **ph > 7**. Bases contain hydroxide ions (OH⁻). When bases are diluted the concentration of OH⁻ ions decreases and pH decreases towards 7 (neutral pH)

> **Acids have a pH less than 7. Bases have a pH greater than 7. Remember it as `a` comes before `b`. Acids come before bases on the pH scale.

Water and neutral solutions has a pH level of 7.

#### Differentiate between strong and weak

You can test for how acidic or basic is using a number of ways. This includes using universal indicator to estimate pH, or test the reactivity of solutions in water.

## Neutralisation Reactions

[Test yourself on Quizlet](https://quizlet.com/_7e3kah){: .btn }

When you mix an acid and a base together, a chemical reaction occurs! The mixture will get warmer and it usually follows this formula:

```
acid + base –> salt + water
```

### Metal oxides and metal hydroxides

Both metal oxides and metal hydroxides are bases

```
metal oxide + acid –> salt + water
metal hydroxide + acid –> salt + water
```

### Metal carbonates

When metal carbonates react with acids, they work the same way as metal oxides and hydroxides but on the reactant side there is also carbon dioxide gas

```
metal carbonate + acid –> salt + water + carbon dioxide
```

#### Example

```
copper oxide + hydrochloric acid –> copper chloride + water
CuO + 2HCl –> CuCl₂ + H₂O
```

Note how chloride in copper chloride on the reactant side has a subscript 2. This is to balance the chemical equation. As copper(II) has a valency of 2 we use the crossover method as covered in [Chemistry 1](chem1.html#crossover-method) and multiplechloride by two. To balance the equation on both sides we add a 2 in front of `HCl` which makes sure there are equal atoms on both the reactant and product side.

```
copper carbonate + nitric acid –> copper nitrate + water + carbon dioxide
CuCO₃ + 2HNO₃ –> Cu(NO₃)₂ + H₂O + CO₂
```

## What happens when acids react with...

### Acids react with bases

When acids and bases react, they neutralise and produce salt and water. 

### Acids react with metals

When acids and metals react, they produce salt and hydrogen gas.

### Acids react with carbonates

When acids and carbonates react, they produce salt, water and carbon dioxide.

#### Extra information

Reactivity: tendency to lose or gain electrons

Reactivity of metal DECREASES from left to right, and INCREASES from up to down. Alkali metals in Group 1 have the highest reactivity, while noble gases in Group 8 are typically unreactive.

I've tried to keep similar concepts together so if you can't find something, feel free to use the textbook, or use that neat little search bar up the top there! Thanks!*

## Common properties

### Acids

Acids are corrosive. They taste sour, and can be used to react with other substances.

Acids are chemicals with a **pH < 7**. Acids contain hydrogen ions (H⁺). When acids are diluted the concentration of H⁺ ions and pH increases towards 7 (neutral pH)

### Bases[^1]

Bases are sometimes corrosive. They are bitter, slippery, and/or soapy. Bases that can be dissolved in water are called **alkalis**.

Bases are chemicals with a **ph > 7**. Bases contain hydroxide ions (OH⁻). When bases are diluted the concentration of OH⁻ ions decreases and pH decreases towards 7 (neutral pH)

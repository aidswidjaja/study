**Comment on the success of the American tactics, using evidence and your own knowledge. **

American tactics in Vietnam were largely deadly and high-impact, however, they did not achieve any progress or success. Largely, the successes made through strong air defence in Operation Rolling Thunder and chemical weapons usage was subsequently set back by the Viet Cong’s guerilla warfare. Chemical weapons such as Agent Orange and Napalm ended up hurting innocent civilians and children most, and even American veterans when they returned home.

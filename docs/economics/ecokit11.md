Introduction to Economics
Topic 1 | Chapter 1
```


Welcome to the fun world of economics! In this course, you will learn:



*   All the economic mechanisms of Pokémon trading
*   Why pirating anime is bad for the economy
*   “Maths is actually used in the real world?”


## The economic problem {#the-economic-problem}

Unlimited wants and needs \
Limited resources \
Hence the problem of **scarcity**

The economic problem forms the backbone of economics. We all want every single Pokémon, but we can’t! Even though everyone wishes they could have all the Pokémon in the world, there is a limited quantity of Pokémon. **The problem of scarcity arises since not all wants can be satisfied at once.**

### Wants and needs {#wants-and-needs}

Wants and needs are the things we desire. They range from food and shelter, to books and video games. We can classify wants and needs into different categories.


<table>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Category</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>Example</strong>
   </td>
  </tr>

```
Note: In Chapter 2, we identify the four basic questions raised by the economic problem, in relation to production, distribution and exchange of goods and services.
```



### Consumer goods {#consumer-goods}

Consumer goods give **immediate satisfaction** for **consumer wants**. A consumer good can be classified into one of two categories:


<table>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Durable</strong>
<p>
Goods that can be used over and over again.
   </td>
   <td>
<ul>

<li>Computers

<li>Fridges

<li>Stoves

<li>Cameras
</li>
</ul>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Single-use</strong>
<p>
Once used, these goods cease to exist.
   </td>
   <td>
<ul>

<li>Plastic bags

<li>Cigarettes

<li>Petrol
</li>
</ul>
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>



```
Definition: In Economics, satisfaction can also be referred to as utility.
```



### Capital goods {#capital-goods}

Capital goods are things such as machines, equipment, and tractors that are used to produce more capital and consumer goods. They are subject to **depreciation**.** **


```
Definition: Depreciation is the decline in usefulness and value of a capital asset over time.

Therefore, they will have to be replaced in the future. For example, a printer may need to be replaced by a newer and more efficient printer in three years.
```



#### Intermediate goods {#intermediate-goods}

Intermediate goods are goods that are **continually introduced to be used in the production of other goods**, but are not goods that will produce for an extended period of time. For example, **seeds** are used to grow bread, **sugar** to make syrup, and **steel** to make bridges. Since seeds, sugar and steel need to be continually resupplied, they would be considered an **intermediate** good.


```
Note: You can think of them as partly-finished, non-durable capital assets. Just don't use this definition in an assessment.
```



### The factors of production {#the-factors-of-production}

The factors of production (resources) are used in the production process to **produce goods and services **to satisfy the wants and needs of consumers. As a result, they also have **factor incomes **(returns) which is the return from the usage of resources. 


<table>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Resources</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>Returns</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>Description</strong>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Land
   </td>
   <td>Rent
   </td>
   <td>Land includes all natural resources such as forests, minerals, rivers, and agricultural land.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Labour
   </td>
   <td>Income
   </td>
   <td>Human effort used in the production of goods. 
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Capital
   </td>
   <td>Interest (subject to depreciation)
   </td>
   <td>Goods that are used to produce more goods and services, such as machinery, plants, tools and equipment.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Enterprise
   </td>
   <td>Enterprise
   </td>
   <td>Enterprise or entrepreneurship refers to the risk-taking involved in business, in order to produce goods and services for others. Entrepreneurs combine the other three factors of production.
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>



```
Definition: The factors of production are also known as resources, while factor incomes are also known as factor income returns.
```



```
Tip: The labour force refers to the number of people who are either employed, or those who are actively seeking work. To calculate the percentage of population in the labour force:

employed + unemployed but actively seeking worktotal population100
```



### The problem of scarcity in production {#the-problem-of-scarcity-in-production}

[Earlier](#bookmark=id.fi98w3g9jjns), we highlighted the issue of scarcity in relation to wants and needs. This idea can be extended to the production of goods and services. Choices needed to be made over how resources should be used in production. There is only a finite amount of land, labour and capital goods. Therefore, firms make choices about how to best use their limited resources, by asking questions about **production**, **resource allocation** and** distribution**:


<table>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Question</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>Dependent on...</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>Description</strong>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>What to produce?</strong>
   </td>
   <td>Consumer/capital goods mix
   </td>
   <td>
<ul>

<li>Firms must determine 
<ul>
 
<li>market demands
 
<li>its own preferences and expertise
</li> 
</ul>
</li> 
</ul>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>How much to produce?</strong>
   </td>
   <td>Consumer demand and resource availability
   </td>
   <td>
<ul>

<li>Firms must satisfy market demand to <strong>maximise revenue</strong> and <strong>minimise costs</strong>
</li>
</ul>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>How to produce?</strong>
   </td>
   <td>Resource availability 
   </td>
   <td>
<ul>

<li>A question of resources and available technology in the production process

<li>Firms aim to produce output at minimum cost
</li>
</ul>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>To whom to distribute?</strong>
   </td>
   <td>Factor incomes and provision of welfare
   </td>
   <td>
<ul>

<li>A management structure is needed to lead the production process

<li>Resources must be compensated for (e.g <strong>profit</strong> for the entrepreneur's risk taking, <strong>income</strong> for human labourers)
</li>
</ul>
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>



```
Note: See Appendix A for a more detailed table on the production, distribution and allocation questions.
```



```
Related: Chapter 2 goes into more detail about how firms respond to the problem of scarcity in production.
```



## The opportunity cost and production possibility curves {#the-opportunity-cost-and-production-possibility-curves}

Opportunity cost refers to the alternative foregone by present consumption or production decisions

**Opportunity cost** is what you give up (the alternative foregone) in choosing to consume something else. It can be represented in terms of material benefit or money. The process of choosing between alternatives is known as **economising**.


```
Example: For example, I might have $20 on me. I could either spend that on buying the latest Demon Slayer merch, or buying the latest Haikyuu!! merch. By choosing Demon Slayer merchandise, the opportunity cost would be the Haikyuu!! merchandise (the alternative foregone).
```



```
Note: The Riley textbook defines opportunity cost as "the cost of the alternative uses of resources". Personally, I disagree with this definition, as opportunity cost actually refers to the benefit you sacrifice in terms of the opportunity foregone. Of course it can be expressed in money, but we don't say that I gave up $500 when I choose to buy a Nintendo Switch instead of a PS5.
```



### Opportunity cost: individuals and societies {#opportunity-cost-individuals-and-societies}

Individuals and societies make choices about which wants and needs should be satisfied in the present.


#### Individuals {#individuals}

It’s 5pm and I just left my video game programming job at Game Freak. For doing a good job with Pokémon Brilliant Diamond & Shining Pearl I get a $100 bonus. I can spend different amounts of this money on various different things. For example:



*   $80 on video games
*   $20 on anime merchandise

Or, I could choose to divide it equally:



*   $50 on video games
*   $50 on anime merchandise

And really, I can divide it in any way. As mentioned before, lowly **consumers** like us cannot get everything in the world, so we need to make choices (economise) between different alternatives. **The rational economic person looks to optimise consumption and maximise their satisfaction.**


```
Definition: Economising is the process of making choices between competing alternatives, in order to optimise consumption subject to a budget or income constraint.
```



#### Societies {#societies}

It’s not just individuals who have to make decisions between competing alternatives. Societies also face similar choices, but there are certain projections we can make by analysing how societies choose to allocate resources and income.

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">More consumer goods & less capital goods in the present</span>**

Societies that produce **more consumer goods & less capital goods in the present **will immediately enjoy higher living standards in the present, but lower living standards in the future.



*   Increased production of consumer goods (e.g food, houses, cars, video game consoles)
*   Decreased investment on capital goods (e.g machines, factories, offices, farms)
*   This will limit future growth of consumer goods and services,  ∴ limiting future living standards

    ```
∴ a focus on current living standards => focus on consumer good production
```



**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">More capital goods & less consumer goods in the present</span>**

Likewise, societies that produce **more consumer goods & less capital goods in the present **will experience lower living standards in the present, but higher living standards in the future.



*   Increased investment on capital goods (e.g machines, factories, offices, farms)
*   Decreased production of consumer goods (e.g food, houses, cars, video game consoles)
*   This will promote future growth of consumer goods and services,  ∴ higher future living standards

    ```
∴ a focus on future living standards => focus on capital good production
```



    ```
Remember: Capital goods depreciate in usefulness and value. A society that does not replace capital goods fast enough to continue economic growth will encounter future issues due to a lack of production capacity.
```




### Production possibility curve {#production-possibility-curve}

A production possibility curve (PPC) is a type of simplistic model that is used to illustrate opportunity cost. Four simplifying assumptions are used in this model:



1. **Only two goods** can be produced with **finite resources**.
2. **All resources are fully employed.** Any point on the curve represents full employment of the economy’s available resources.
3. Level of technology in the economy is constant/fixed.
4. Resources are **finite and mobile**: they can be switched from one type of production to another.

Let’s start with a production possibility schedule, which outlines points on the production possibility curve.

**Production possibility schedule for Fishtopia**


<table>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Rubber Duck Production</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>0</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>100</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>200</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>300</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>400</strong>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Bath Bomb Production</strong>
   </td>
   <td>600
   </td>
   <td>450
   </td>
   <td>300
   </td>
   <td>150
   </td>
   <td>0
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Point on the curve</strong>
   </td>
   <td>P
   </td>
   <td>A
   </td>
   <td>B
   </td>
   <td>C
   </td>
   <td>Q
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>


For every 100 units of rubber ducks, 150 units of bath bombs are sacrificed. In other words, 150 units of bath bombs is the **opportunity cost** of 100 units of rubber ducks. Therefore, we can calculate the **marginal rate of substitution (MRS):**



<p id="gdcalert1" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: equation: use MathJax/LaTeX if your publishing platform supports it. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert2">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>





<p id="gdcalert2" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: equation: use MathJax/LaTeX if your publishing platform supports it. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert3">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>



So, let’s now illustrate this using a production possibility curve.



<p id="gdcalert3" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image1.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert4">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image1.png "image_tooltip")



```
Note: In this example, the MRS is constant, hence the gradient of the PPC is linear, as all resources are fully substitutable into each product.  Later, we'll see what happens when there is a non-linear PPC and thus, a non-constant MRS.
```


**Taking a look at the points on the linear PPC:**



*   At point **P**, all of Fishtopia’s resources are dedicated to making bath bombs.
*   At point **A**, more of Fishtopia’s resources are dedicated into making bath bombs than rubber ducks.
*   At point **B**, it is about even, with 300 bath bombs and 200 rubber ducks being produced.
*   At point **C**, more of Fishtopia’s resources are dedicated into making rubber ducks than bath bombs.
*   At point **Q**, all of Fishtopia’s resources are dedicated to making rubber ducks.

**How about the points outside the PPC?**



*   At point **X**, there are unemployed resources. This could mean that some of the labour market is unemployed, not all land is being used, or not all capital goods are being used.
*   At point **G**, this represents a future production possibility curve if production capacity increased. We’ll take a look at the different ways an economy might see this occur. Currently, this however is unattainable.


### Changes in the economy {#changes-in-the-economy}

A production possibility curve may expand for one of three reasons:



1. More resources are discovered
2. Increase in productivity of existing resources
3. Technological progress

What would this cause the production possibility curve to look like then?


#### Changes in resources {#changes-in-resources}

At **P<sub>1</sub>**, the economy is great! More coal has been found to power new factories, more land stolen from the Republic of Hamsteria, and overall there is a general increase in the number of resources. Alternatively, existing resources are made more productive. That Prius the factory bought is pretty efficient! Therefore, the **production potential for Fishtopia shifts outwards** towards P<sub>1</sub> compared to P.

In an alternate universe, things aren’t looking too good. Everything sucks, there isn’t enough coal and the battery in the Prius died out. All the machinery is from 1892 and the eyes of the rubber ducks are drawn by hand. Oh damn it, a convenient tropical cyclone wiped out half of the machines. Therefore, the **production potential for Fishtopia shifts inwards** towards P<sub>2</sub> compared to P.

![alt_text](images/image2.png "image_tooltip")



#### Improvement in the level of technology {#improvement-in-the-level-of-technology}

Here, Fishtopia has innovated and created a machine that can produce rubber ducks more efficiently. The eyeball stamper is now much faster than before, therefore, Fishtopia’s production capacity of rubber ducks has increased. 



<p id="gdcalert5" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image3.png).

![alt_text](images/image3.png "image_tooltip")



### The concave production possibility curve {#the-concave-production-possibility-curve}

When a production possibility curve is concave about the origin, therefore it means that resources are not perfectly substitutable.



<p id="gdcalert6" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image4.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert7">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image4.png "image_tooltip")


_yes i’m too lazy to draw my own so here is one from the textbook_


```
Definition: When resources are perfectly substitutable this means that the opportunity cost of producing one good vs another increases, as production of that good increases. This occurs when it is easier to dedicate resources to one product as opposed to another.
```



```
Example: In a hypothetical economy, I might produce two things: wagyu and anime. If my economy has land more suited to farming cows, then it would mean that producing wagyu is easier than producing anime using that resource. Therefore, the resources are not perfectly substitutable.
```



### Allocative efficiency {#allocative-efficiency}

**Allocative efficiency** is the allocation of resources according to the preferences of consumers and societies for certain goods and services, in order to **maximise utility and returns.**


```
Definition: In Economics, utility means satisfaction.
```


Current choices have future implications. This is known as the **intertemporal **budget constraint.


```
Definition: The intertemporal budget constraint: when consumption/saving choices affect our current and future living standards and availability of money.
```



### Consumers {#consumers}

omg!! It’s **Roy** from Fire Emblem: The Binding Blade. Roy, being the poor kid he is, has a **budget constraint** which means he needs to decide how much of his income he wants to save for the future, and how much he wants to spend now. In Australia, most people save 5-10% of their income for future utility through voluntary private saving. They also save for retirement through superannuation.


```
Note: The mandatory superannuation guarantee levy (SGL) in Australia is 9.5% at time of writing, although some people may voluntarily save more.
```



### Businesses {#businesses}

Firms also have to make decisions about how they consume, and how much to save.



*   Do we produce anime or manga?
*   From our profits, should we distribute dividends, or retain the money for future investment?
*   How much do we invest (e.g in new technology) to increase future competitiveness?


### Governments {#governments}

Governments mainly source income from taxation, fines, and the privatisation & profits from [PTE](#bookmark=id.dhmfmnrjw64z)s. They make consumption decisions on a variety of different community services and infrastructure projects like:



*   Schools
*   Roads
*   Health
*   Social security
*   Fire department

If the government budgets for a **deficit** then government spending exceeds government revenue. Therefore, it may presently experience higher debt, and lower spending in the future.

If the government budgets for a **surplus** then government revenue exceeds government spending. Therefore, it may be able to repay debt and spend more money in the future.


## Economic factors underlying decision making {#economic-factors-underlying-decision-making}

Economic factors will influence the decision making of conusmers, firms and governments. For instance, if a society has a lot of **weebs**, they will probably consume a lot of **anime**.


### Consumers {#consumers}

The basic macroeconomic relationship between income, consumption and saving is denoted as:



<p id="gdcalert7" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: equation: use MathJax/LaTeX if your publishing platform supports it. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert8">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>



where:



*   **Y** = income
*   **C **= consumption
*   **S** = saving

    ```
Note: You'll see this macroeconomic relationship on the 3-sector circular flow model.
```



**Keynes** proposes three main reasons for why people save:



1. **Transactionary motive** to finance the purchase of goods and services
2. **Precautionary motive** as a precaution, such as in the case of unforeseen expenses
3. **Speculative motive** to invest money in order to earn a return (e.g shares, bonds, real estate)

    ```
Note: There are two main economists that are worth noting. 

John Maynard Keynes, who was an early pioneer of macroeconomics and governmental intervention, advocated for government intervention in the form of fiscal and monetary policies during economic downturn (even if running into a deficit), published in The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money (1936). He also had a major role in shaping the international economy post-World War II.
Friedrich von Hayek, a graduate of the Chicago School of Economics, defended classical free market liberalism in economics, and was particularly important in understanding the price signal. He believed private investment in public markets.

Keynes and Hayek disagreed with each other, Keynes leaning towards the planned economy, and Hayek more towards the free market. However, both made important contributions to economics in the 20th century, especially after the Second World War.
```



Other factors that will affect financial decision making include:



*   **Education**, as higher education increases the potential of income that can be gained
*   **Work**, as more-skilled employment will usually produce higher income and therefore, higher standards of living
*   **Retirement,** as emphasis on self funded retirement is a major pillar of Australia’s domestic economic policy through both compulsory and voluntary superannuation
*   **Political views**, as one’s political views is often reflective of their economic standards and effects of their policy platforms on households


### Businesses {#businesses}

Businesses aim for the maximisation of profit, and as such, will make choices such as how much output, what the most efficient combination of capital and labour is, etc.

Prices will usually be determined by production costs, and there will be a mark up. Therefore, the **cost plus pricing** principle is:



<p id="gdcalert8" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: equation: use MathJax/LaTeX if your publishing platform supports it. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert9">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>



where mark up is the profit margin to the entrepreneur.

Labour costs represent over 70% of production costs, which is why employers and employees will often negotiate wages and working conditions. The government regulates this in three main ways:



*   The _Fair Work Act 2009_ contains the National Employment Standards which outline the minimum working conditions
*   The Modern Award system administered by the Fair Work Commission establishes minimum wage for various types of work
*   The National Minimum Wage provides the absolute baseline minimum wage

Since 1991 negotiations have been deregulated in favour of** enterprise bargaining**. Employees, often through a trade union, directly negotiate with their employer in good faith. It must pass a “better off overall test” however, to ensure that the government-mandated standards are not sidestepped.


### Government {#government}

Government influences decision making for households and firms in four main ways:



1. **Allocation of resources** through spending for the provision of infrastructure (e.g police, education, health, defence).
2. **Stabilisation of economic activity** through **monetary **and **fiscal** policy (e.g reducing interest rates, budgeting for a deficit).
3. **Progressive system of taxation** where individuals are taxed according to the level of income they earn. Taxation is then used to fund** transfer payments** such as pensions and social security.
4. **Regulation and fair trading** to protect individual consumer rights and encourage competition (e.g price regulation, minimum wage, and resource regulation)

    ```
Definition: A transfer payment is a redistribution of income and wealth from the government, making a payment without receiving goods or services in return.

```
The Operation of an Economy
Topic 1 | Chapter 2
```


An **economy** refers to the way in which a **society is organised** in order to solve the economic problem of scarcity.

There are two main types of economic systems:



*   The free market (aka capitalism)
*   The planned economy (aka communism)

Economies need to perform the three functions of **production**, **distribution** and **exchange**.  



*   What to produce?
*   How much to produce?
*   How to produce
*   To whom to distribute

    ```
Note: See Appendix A for a more detailed table on the production, distribution and allocation questions.
```



    ```

```




#### What to produce? {#what-to-produce}



*   Societies will prefer certain goods over others.
*   Producers are guided by these preferences to meet consumer demand for a variety of goods and services.
*   Efficient allocation of resources = satisfaction of consumers’ wants and needs = profit maximisation for producers — aka **allocative efficiency**

    ```
Based on demand and society's preferences.
Which combination of goods and services will maximise society's utility?
When deciding what to produce, we maximise the returns from using the available resources.
```




#### How much to produce? {#how-much-to-produce}



*   Dependent on the** pattern of consumer demand**, and **available resources**.
*   The volume of production must coincide with the volume of demand, in order to achieve the most efficient allocation of resources.
*

 = **efficient allocation of resources**

    ```
Based on consumer demand and resource availability
Which combination of goods and services will maximise society's utility?
When deciding what to produce, we maximise the returns from using the available resources.
```




#### How to produce? {#how-to-produce}



*   The method of production is dependent on **resource availability** and the **level of technology**
*   The incentive of **profit maximisation **means producers will attempt to minimise production costs through .
*   **Resources which are scarce relative to others will command higher prices to reflect that scarcity.**
*   In developing countries, **labour intensive production methods** are used more as unskilled labour is abundant and wages are low relative to the cost of capital.
*   In developed countries, **capital intensive production methods** are generally used as capital is more abundant and cheaper to employ relative to higher cost labour.

    ```
Based on resource availability, costs and the state of technology.
The method of production is motivated by profit.
```




#### To whom to distribute? {#to-whom-to-distribute}



*   Higher levels of personal income = greater ability to purchase goods and services ∴ **higher standard of living.**
    *   Income is determined by employment, productivity, and contribution to production.

        ```
Distribution of output depends on individual incomes.
```




## Economic systems {#economic-systems}

In the current world, there are two main economic systems, the capitalistic **market economy** and the socialist/communist **planned economy.**


### Market economy {#market-economy}

Market economies let the market allocate resources via the **price mechanism. **The price mechanism acts as a **rationing device** in the distribution process between producers and consumers. Income distribution in market economies are usually uneven as individuals are free to accumulate money and wealth. However, many governments provide welfare and a basic safety net. **Transfer payments **are made to the sick, unemployed, the disabled, veterans and others through a **progressive taxation system. **


```
Definition: A progressive taxation system redistributes income from high income earners to low income earners, making the distribution of income less unequal (compared to an absolute market economy).
```



#### The price mechanism {#the-price-mechanism}

Prices are monetary indicators of the relative value of goods and services in an economy. A loaf of bread might cost $5, and a car $50,000. Therefore, the car is worth more than bread. The price mechanism:



1. **Matches output of producers, with the demand of consumers.** Increase in demand = rise in price.
2. **Rations limited supply of resources and commodities.** Increased scarcity = rise in price.
3. **Prevents wastage of resources** by avoiding shortages/surpluses in relation to demand. Producers are encouraged to match supply with demand (i.e. allocative efficiency).
4. **Act as signalling devices** to adjust economic behaviour.


### Planned economy {#planned-economy}

Countries such as Cuba and North Korea are **planned economies**. The government is responsible for determining income and prices. The distribution of income is more equal, and prices of basic wants and needs are subsidised to make them affordable. 

In former planned economies such as the Soviet Union and Poland, political elites usually had access to more money than the general public. Basic consumer goods were also in short supply, and now many formerly planned economies are opening up towards becoming more like a market economy.

```
Note: The textbook blabbles a lot here about stuff I've already covered so I'm just going to ignore that :D
```



### Investment {#investment}

Investment is the process by which capital is accumulated for future want satisfaction.



<p id="gdcalert12" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: equation: use MathJax/LaTeX if your publishing platform supports it. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert13">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>




### Interest {#interest}


```
Note: We didn't cover this in class, so I'm not sure if it's too important to revise.
```


**Interest** is the cost of borrowing funds for investment purposes.



*   The rate of interest is the **annual percentage return** paid to lenders for the borrowers of funds.
*   It is determined by demand and supply of funds or money.


#### Real interest rate {#real-interest-rate}



<p id="gdcalert13" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: equation: use MathJax/LaTeX if your publishing platform supports it. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert14">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>



where: 



*   the **nominal interest rate** is the interest rate before taking inflation into account

If inflation rises, nominal interest rates will rise to maintain the real interest rate (and therefore, the real return on borrowed funds).


### Factor income returns {#factor-income-returns}

Factor income returns are influenced by the productivity of each factor of production. They are paid to households by firms for the use of productive resources.

**Disposable income **is the income available to households after taxation:



<p id="gdcalert14" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: equation: use MathJax/LaTeX if your publishing platform supports it. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert15">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>



**Final income **is all income, including government transfer payments, minus all taxation, including indirect taxes such as GST:



<p id="gdcalert15" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: equation: use MathJax/LaTeX if your publishing platform supports it. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert16">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>




### Provision of income {#provision-of-income}



*   <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Households</span> provide resources to firms and governments through **factor markets**, in return for factor incomes.
*   <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Firms</span> supply goods and services to households through **goods markets, **in return for money expenditure.
*   <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Governments</span> provide goods & services and transfer payments to households and firms, and collect taxes from households and firms.

![alt_text](images/image5.png "image_tooltip")



## Provision of employment and the quality of life {#provision-of-employment-and-the-quality-of-life}

The high level of **specialisation** in the economy leads to **interdependence** between households, firms and governments.



*   Households depend on firms for the provision of employment and the payment of income.
*   Firms depend on expenditure from households for their income.
*   Governments collect taxes to provide collective goods and services, and transfer payments.

    ```
Definition: Specialisation (or the division of labour) is when individuals, firms or economies concentrate on producing a few goods and services that they are best at.
```



    ```
Definition: Interdependence, as a consequence of specialisation, means that participants in the economy rely on the economy to obtain products they cannot produce efficiently for themselves.
```

The **three sector model** contains these sectors:



*   Households
*   Firms
*   Financial

where **savings** are leakages as there will be less demand for goods and services from firms due to lower expenditure from households, and **investment** are injections to businesses wishing to invest in new capital or plant.

Businesses (also known as firms) play a big role in the economy. Unlike Pokémon Centers in the Pokémon video games, most things aren’t free. Instead, businesses produce and sell products in order to gain the **maximum return** by **minimising costs**. So, more like the Pokémon Center in Tokyo. Where you actually have to pay.

## Production periods {#production-periods}



*   In the **short run**, some costs (e.g capital) are fixed and some costs are variable
*   In the **long run** (planning period), all costs are variable as firms can expand or contract in operations

    ```
Example: 
In the short run, there can be fixed costs (e.g rent) or variable costs (e.g wages).
In the long run, all costs are variable. Expansion through increasing productive capacity will contribute to growth in output, employment of labour, and resources (e.g raw material, capital). Or, the firm may wind down if it is not turning a profit.

## The goals of a firm {#the-goals-of-a-firm}


### Profit maximisation {#profit-maximisation}

The main goal that is assumed to apply to a firm’s market behaviour in economics is **profit maximisation.**

## Efficiency and the production process {#efficiency-and-the-production-process}

The main sources of productivity improvements arises from either one of the following means:



*   The division and specialisation of labour
*   The specialisation or localisation of land or industry
*   The specialisation of capital or large scale production

   <td>
<ul>

<li>Structural unemployment through deskilling of labour

<li>Higher rates of structural and technological change in production and industry
</li>
</ul>
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>



#### Specialisation {#specialisation}

The specialisation of labour will result in higher efficiency, therefore increased output per unit of labour (higher APP). 


```
Example: A cashier who is skilled and confident at their job, and does not need to be trained, will be able to serve more customers than a trainee cashier who will be slower at their job.
```



## Law of diminishing returns {#law-of-diminishing-returns}

The **law of diminishing returns** or variable proportions proposes that in the **short run**:

Adding increased amounts of variable factors to fixed factors \
will affect total output, therefore diminishing returns.

When considering the law of diminishing returns, we use a simplistic model using the following assumptions:



*   There is only **land (fixed)** and **labour (variable)**
*   The level of technology and other factors of production remain **constant**

In the economic model, various quantities of the **variable** factor are used in combination with the **fixed** factor, resulting in changes in output.


### Production function {#production-function}



*   The **total physical product** (TPP) is the total output
*   The **average physical product **(APP) is the average output per unit of variable factor (e.g labour)
*   The **marginal physical product **(MPP) is the extra output per an additional unit of variable factor

```
Example: In a coffee shop, adding labour for a few people might increase efficiency, allowing output to be produced at faster rates (increasing returns). As you add more people, you'll see that adding labour may increase output and efficiency, but at a slower rate than before (diminishing returns). And adding too many people in a small coffee shop, will result in them bumping into each other, and possibly not being as efficient as before (negative returns).
```



### Short run average cost curve {#short-run-average-cost-curve}

The** short run average cost curve** (SRAC) is a concave up parabolic curve which represents the average cost per unit of variable input, based on the law of diminishing returns.



<p id="gdcalert41" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image10.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert42">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image10.png "image_tooltip")




*   The **x-axis** is output (TPP) or units of variable input (e.g labour)
*   The **y-axis** is average cost per unit

At the lowest point on the graph, this is known as the **technical optimum (TO)**, where the average cost per unit of variable input is at its lowest.


```
Remember: Short run assumes both fixed (e.g capital) and variable (e.g labour) costs.
```



```
Note: The technical optimum is what most firms aim towards, however some may decide to make different choices. For example, if a company needs to fill orders and retain customers, they may use more resources at a higher cost per unit.
```



## Economies of scales {#economies-of-scales}


### Long run average cost curve {#long-run-average-cost-curve}

With a series of short run average cost curves, we can determine a** long run average cost curve **(LRAC). It has the same axis as the LRAC.



<p id="gdcalert42" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image11.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert43">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image11.png "image_tooltip")



```
Remember: Economies of scale only apply to long run.
```



#### Internal economies of scale {#internal-economies-of-scale}

Before the technical optimum (OX—OY), **as output increases, cost per unit reduces**. This can result from the following:



*   **Specialisation and division of labour** for higher labour productivity and output.
*   **Specialisation of capital** to raise total factor productivity, especially labour productivity, increasing TPP.
*   **Lower input costs** through discounted purchase of resources in bulk.
*   **Access to cheaper finance** with lower interest rates due to a lessened risk of borrowing.
*   **Reusing waste material** from large scale production.
*   **Research and development** that leads to new products and processes, to lower production costs and increase sales of output.


#### Internal diseconomies of sales {#internal-diseconomies-of-sales}

Beyond the technical optimum (OY—OZ), **as output further increases, cost per unit increases.** This can result from the following:



*   **Management of the firm becomes too complex and costly** to coordinate due to lack of communication and bureaucratic inefficiencies.
*   **Increased output may only occur with more variable factors** raising variable costs, therefore increasing average costs.
*   **Congestion in the production process** from errors in production, and higher distribution & administrative costs will make rising average costs difficult to reduce.


#### External economies of scale {#external-economies-of-scale}

Factors outside the firm’s direct control, may result in reductions in average costs. Naisu. This could occur because of the following:



*   **Lower resource costs **with closer proximity to natural resources.
*   **Improved transport facilities **such as expanded rail.
*   **Proximity to a higher-skilled labour force **(e.g technology park).
*   **Government-funded research and development** to improve the production process or create new products.
*   **Lower cost of finance** from growth opportunities within the entire industry.

    ```
Note: With external economies of scale, the entire LRAC shifts downward.
```




#### External diseconomies of scale {#external-diseconomies-of-scale}

Factors outside the firm’s direct control, may also result in increases in average costs. Oof. This could occur because of the following:



*   **Higher resource costs** due to increased competition between firms.
*   **Increased government regulation **(e.g environmental regulation).
*   **Higher labour costs** due to a shortage of labour.
*   **Increased congestion and pollution** (e.g lack of parking, higher traffic congestion).

    ```
Note: With external diseconomies of scale, the entire LRAC shifts upward.
```

Demand and Supply
Topic 3 | Chapter 6
```


How many hot dogs will you buy?


## The theory of demand

Demand refers to the quantity demanded of a good or service by consumers at a particular price point.


```
Definition: Effective demand refers to the ability for consumers to both desire and pay for goods and services
```



#### Individual demand factors

Individual demand is affected by:



*   **Price** where a higher price usually means a lower quantity demanded.
*   **Price of other goods and services** where relative prices of substitute or complementary goods and services will affect demand.
*   **Individual income **where a higher individual income usually means a higher quantity demanded.
*   **Personal preferences and taste **where if I like pineapples, imma buy more pineapples.


#### Market demand factors

Market demand is affected by:



*   **Population demographics** such as population, age composition, social-economic status and distribution of people. For example, an ageing population may result in creased demand for healthcare and pharmaceuticals.
*   **Distribution of consumer and household incomes**, where more equal distribution of income may lead to a rise in demand for luxury consumer durables.
*   **Customer expectations about the future**,** **where if consumers expect a price of a good or service to fall in the future, they may purchase larger quantities now.
*   **Level of technological progress**, where if better quality products are produced, it may lead to increased demand for that product or service.

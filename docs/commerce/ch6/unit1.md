> Imagine driving along a busy road and suddenly experiencing the aroma of grilled steak. The Bloom grocery store chain in North Carolina erected a giant outdoor display as part of its marketing campaign to promote and sell a new brand of beef. The sign uses high-powered fans to waft the aroma of charcoal-grilled pepper steak over hungry commuters during rush hour. Scent marketing is rapidly becoming popular. Officeworks uses coffee scent at its South Melbourne store, and the scent of chocolate will be diffused through Federation Square during the Melbourne Food and Wine Festival. Market research has shown that consumers who associate a smell with a pleasant experience are more likely to make a purchase. In order to succeed, businesses are constantly looking for innovative ways to promote and sell their products.

## The selling process

With so many options, businesses have to differentiate their product. **Product differentiation** is when products that are the same or similar are made to appear different and/or better than those of their competitors.

### Customer service
- Customer service is important to customers
- Presentation, atmosphere and exclusivity can capture a customer's interest
- For example, a [really nice restaurant](https://pilu.com.au) with a tasting menu, table service and wine selections will be differentiated from [a fish and chips store](http://www.blackheathfishandchips.com.au/).

### Convenience
- Products that are quick, convenient, and easy to use are differentiated from products that take ages to make
- Uncle Bens is one such company which provides quick cook rice! It was so popular of Duke of Ed!!!

### Environment & social and ethical issues
- Products that are more environmentally-oriented may increase scales
- The Body Shop is a good case study of an environmentally-friendly company. For more information, see [Ethical investments](ch5/unit1.html#case-study-1).
- Ethical consumerism: buying products that are not harmful to the environment, animals and society 
- Companies that operate ethically (e.g don't exploit workers or conduct animal testing) can become more popular with consumers
- Fairtrade-certified products have been certified for ethical and sustainable conduct

### Product positioning & value for money
- Products will be promoted at different prices depending on how a seller wants to position their product. Arguably, Quilton 29-ply toilet paper will be more premium than Coles 1-ply industrial toilet paper.
- Luxurious items that are branded suggest an image of a product's quality

## Product promotion strategies

### Promotion

**Promotion is the methods used by a business to inform, persuade and remind customers about its products.** This can involve:
- attracting new customers through raising awareness of a product
- increasing brand loyalty by reinforcing the image of the product
- encouraging existing customers to purchase more of the product
- encouraging new and existing customers to purchase new products

A promotion mix is the various promotion strategies a business uses in its promotional campaign. Do not confuse advertising with promotion; advertising is one part of the promotion mix!

### Advertising

**Advertising is a paid, non-personal message** often distributed through mass media. It allows a business to reach either a large audience or a small distinct population. This could involve:
- mass marketing (TV, radio, newspapers)

- direct marketing catelogues (catalogues mailed to individual households)

- telemarketing (contacting potential customers by telephone)

- [online advertising](https://www.abc.net.au/news/science/2019-05-22/clive-palmer-election-advertising-google-facebook-transparency/11133596) (Google, social media such as Facebook and Twitter)

- billboards (large signs in strategic locations)

Oh wait... that last one wasn't exactly advertising.

### Relationship marketing

**Relationship marketing is the development of long-term relationships with individual customers.** It creates customer loyalty by meeting the needs of customers on an individual basis.

### Sponsorship

**Sponsorship promotes a product by assosciating it with a specific event.** It can be used to promote a product towards a specific demographic with a common interest. Product endorsement occurs when celebrities express their appreciation and support for a product.

### Publicity

**Publicity is any free news story about a business's products.** It can be negative, but when positive can enhance the image of a product and raise awareness of it.

### Sales promotion

**Sales promotion is the use of activities or materials as direct inducements to customers.** The main aims of it is to entice new customers and encourage trial purchase of the product. Examples include coupons, loyalty reward programs and samples.

### Gender

Advertising is often targeted towards one gender or another, and it utilises stereotypes to reinforce this message. This is now starting to be criticised because a lot of the time sex appeal is being used to advertise this product.

*I'm thinking of an example of an advert with sex appeal but I'm trying to keep it PG-13 on Adrian's Study Club.*

## Target market

**Market segmentation occurs when the total market is subdivided into groups of people who share one or more common cahracteristics.** The market can be subdivided into groups such as age, gender, income level, educational background, geographical location, lifestyle and family structure. Once a market is segmented one of these segments is designated as the target market.

![Target market](http://content.jacplus.com.au/secure/ebooks/11184/1118401042/images/06_source-12.jpg)

**Target market is the group of customers to whom the business intends to sell its product.** Promotion efforts are concentrated on that group. A business can have a primary target market (where most marketing resources are directed) and a secondary target market (a less important segment). The primary target market generates most revenue while the secondary is a good alternative and back-up plan (in case there is a loss of customers from the primary target market).

Businesses that target small segments is known as niche marketing. Niche marketing targets a segment within a segment (or a micromarket!) So if you're a cosplay designer, you're targeting a very niche market. A *very* niche market.

## Legislation
### the [chocolate game](ch1/unit3.html#legislation) is still in effect

The Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cwth) outlaws false and misleading advertising. However, businesses continue to convey a false impression of their product by:
- exaggerating claims that cannot be proved
- vague statements that distort one sentence into an intended message (that the business can later deny)
- before and after advertisements that have been digitally edited
- special offers that aren't really that special

## Ethical issues

### Advertising terms

Terms such as 'low fat', 'huge reduction' and 'limited offer' can be interpreted in different ways. If a business attempts to mislead customers by using this term it would be unethical and possibly even illegal. 

### Children's advertising

Marketing of junk food is being criticised as childhood obesity rates rise, especially as it is portrayed as healthy when this is not the case.

### Invasion of privacy

While most websites infer consent to track them, etc, most consumers don't know how their data is being used, when in fact it is probably being used for advertising purposes. In some cases this might breach privacy laws.

### Materialism

Materialism is an individual's desire to constantly acquire possessions. Some may argue that firms create a consumer's needs to acquire products they may not require.

### Product placement

Some movies feature product placement: the inclusion of advertising in entertainment. This is usually subtle, but some people argue that it blurs the lines between advertising and entertainment. Personally I think this is a stupid point; in the last page I did some product placement for Clive Palmer, and I think that the advertisement *was the entertainment*.

## The 5-sector model

![5-sector circular flow model](http://content.jacplus.com.au/secure/ebooks/11184/1118401042/images/13_source-05.jpg)

Savings, Taxation and Imports are  **Leakages**. 

Investment, Government expenditure, and Exports are **Injections**.

When `Leakages > Injections` there is a decline in economic activity. When `Injections > Leakages` there is an increase in economic activity.

Note that:
- **Households** provide **Firms** with the Factors of Production (e.g Labour) _and_ Consumption
- **Firms** provide **Households** with Goods and Services _and_ Income 
- In order to achieve **equibrilium**, **S**avings, **T**axation and I**m**ports must equal **I**nvestment, **G**overnment Expenditure, and E**x**ports. This is represented by the equation...

# I + G + X = S + T + M

Because the 5-sector model featurs 5 sectors (Households, Firms, Financial, Government, Overseas) and it is circular (look at those arrows!) it is known as a **macroeconomic model**

the study of the economy as a whole.

We use money instead of bartering goods because it means more links between sectors.

## The business cycle

The business cycle is the cyclical fluctuations (i.e booms and recessions) in the general level of economic activity

![Business cycle](http://content.jacplus.com.au/secure/ebooks/11184/1118401042/images/13_source-07.jpg)

![Contraction v Expansion](http://content.jacplus.com.au/secure/ebooks/11184/1118401042/images/13_source-07a.jpg)

1. An **expansion** occurs when there is an __increase__ in economic activity.
2. A **contraction** occurs when there is a __decrease__ in economic activity.
3. A **recession** occurs when there has been a significant contraction in economic activity (typically a significant decline in GDP over two quarters).
4. A **depression** occurs when there is a more severe economic decline compared to a recession, characterised by years of GDP failing and increasing unemployment.

Fluctuations in the Business Cycle occur because of either too little spending, or too much spending.

### Recessions and Depressions - too little spending

Recessions and depressions are characterised by a lack of spending. Key features include:

- Income and production at its lowest level
- Unemployment at its highest level
- Limited wage growth
- Consumer demand at its lowest level
- Business sales and profit at its lowest levels
- Business expansion/investment at its lowest levels
- Low inflation rates and interest rates

## Boom - too much spending

Booms are characterised by too much spending. Key features include: 

- Income and production at its highest level
- Unemployment at its lowest level
- High wage growth
- Business investment and expansion
- Increased demand = increased prices
- High interest rates and inflation rates

## The role of government

Our economy is a **mixed economy** - an economic system in which individuals and businesses make their own decisions but with a degree of government involvement. The government controls different aspects of **fiscal policy** and **monetary policy**.

<details>
<summary>Definition of Fiscal Policy</summary>
Fiscal policy is the use of government revenue collection and expenditure to influence a country's economy.[^1]
</details>

<details>
<summary>Definition of Monetary Policy</summary>
Monetary policy is the policy adopted by the monetary authority of a country that controls either the interest rate payable on very short-term borrowing or the money supply, often targeting inflation or the interest rate to ensure price stability and general trust in the currency.[^2]

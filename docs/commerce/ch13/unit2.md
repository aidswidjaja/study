##### I'm so interested in interest rates!

## Saving and borrowing

So assuming you know about interest rates and didn't just spend the last two years playing games in class and chewing gum...

We know that people earn interest when making a deposit with a financial institution, and that financial institutions charge interest when you borrow money from them. Naisu.

People who lend money have spare money have a **surplus** while people who need more money have a **deficit**.

## Short-term/Long-term interest rates

- **Short-term** interest rates tend to be for shorter terms like from 1-12 months
- **Long-term** interest rates tend to be quite long going up to 20 years!!

Interest rates are usually controlled and/or influenced by the Reverse Bank of Australia (the RBA).

- **High interest rates** encourage and incentivises saving in order to prevent an economy from expanding too quickly
- **Low interest rates** discourages saving in order to encourage consumer spending

### Fixed interest rates

- Fixed loan for the entire term
    - Protection from unexpected rate increases (but also cannot take advantage from rate decreases)
    - Predictable payments
    - Early payout penalty if the loan is cleared before the expiration of the term

### Variable interest rates

- Variable loan that moves up and down over the term
    - If interest rates fall, repayments reduce (but if they rise, repayments increase)
    - Maintaining the higher repayment means you can shorten the term of the loan
    - Additional repayments don't incur a penalty
    - You might have to increase repayments if you can't pay back within the agreed term

### Other loans
- Combination loan - fixed for an initial period (usually up to 10 years) then reverts to variable rate
- Split loan - Part of the loan is fixed and part of the loan is variable (usually more fixed than variable)

## Effects of interest rates

Rising interest rates encourage saving, while falling interest rates discourage saving.

Variable interest rates can affect whether someone can pay their loan, and whether they'll be inclined to take a new one. Sometimes, when people can't pay back their loans, they have to default on it. Oops.

The inability to repay borrowed money.

So this basically means, that people have to choose between a safe, fixed interest rate that can end up being more expensive, or a riskier, variable interest rate that could put you in the red zone if interest rates go up.

People can choose, yknow. And that's what we call a **personal investment strategy**. So, yea, go ahead and start showing off on r/wallstreetbets.

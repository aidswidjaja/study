# 5.1 – Investment Decisions and 5.2 – Financing Investment

### Investment: when money is spent to gain profit.

Businesses, governments and individuals carry out investment. There are many different type of investment, including:

* savings account
* term deposits
* shares 
* cash management account
* managed fund
* property
* superannuation
* debentures and unsecured notes

Financing an investment can be done either through personal savings or borrowing. Advantages of saving for an investment means no interest is paid, but you might had to have extra costs (e.g paying rent while saving for a house)

Loans have different features. Personal loans can be secured or unsecured. Home loans can either have a fixed interest rate or a variable interest rate.

A **fixed interest rate** is a constant rate. The repayment amount is always the same.

A **variable interest rate** moves up or down depending on the market. A variable rate continually changes and fluctuates. This is usually done through the RBA.

> "Summer is here! It is time to throw on the sunglasses, wax the surfboard, jump in the car and head for the beach. No cares, no responsibilities, just fun in the sun. For teenagers, summer can be exciting, with opportunities to enjoy the company of friends doing a whole range of activities.

> Along with the many exciting challenges of being a teenager, though, come new responsibilities. To get to the beach or pool, teenagers need to manage their money wisely. Pocket money or wages earned through casual work may help to provide the sunglasses and the boardshorts; however, the purchase of a car will probably be the result of a longer term savings plan. To put petrol in the car and pay for repairs also requires careful financial management.

> It’s possible — and the earlier we start to organise our personal finances, the better!"

### Expenditure

The economic problem: infinite needs and wants but finite means.

Therefore, most of our expenses go towards taxes and bills. They remain the same amount every time and are known as fixed expenses. Sometimes, we might go and buy a Chatime for ourselves. This is an example of a variable expense; expenses that change over time.

## Saving

Reasons for saving money is different for everybody:
- Save for a larger purchase (e.g a house) – this might need to be supported by a loan
- Extra backup money in case of emergencies that can affect someone and their dependants – to save for a rainy day
- Older working people put aside money for retirement in a superannuation for security and maintain their quality of living
- Satisfaction and pleasure like how Mr Mean counts his coins

Saving can be easy by formulating a savings plan. Savings plan is a commitment to a medium/long-term plan that can either be flexible or strict. It can be impacted by impulse buying, the unplanned purchase of goods and services.

Here is a stupid cringy image on savings plans:

Credit cards have many advntages such as:
- avoid carrying lots of cash

### EFTPOS and BPAY

Debit cards are different to credit cards.

- In credit cards, you use other people's money and are charged interest.
- In debit cards, you are using your own money and only pay account operating fees.

Using debit cards is most common with EFTPOS – electronic funds transfer at point of sale. EFTPOS is a computerised system to transfer money from a customer's account to a business's account.

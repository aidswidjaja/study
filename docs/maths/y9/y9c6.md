## Index notation

```
3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 = 3⁷
```

## Scientific notation
science!
```
a x 10ᵐ
where m is an integer
and 1 <= a < 10
```

## Prime factorisation

Writing a number as a product of its prime factors.

```
108 = 2 x 2 x 3 x 3 x 3
    = 2² x 3³
```

On Casio calculators, you can obtain the prime factorisation of any inputted number by pressing `SHIFT + DMS button`.

On Sharp calculators, well, I don't know.

## Index laws

### Multiplication and division
```
aᵐ x bⁿ = aᵐ⁺ⁿ
aᵐ ÷ bⁿ = aᵐ⁻ⁿ
```
### Powers and brackets
```
(aᵐ)ⁿ = aᵐⁿ
(ab)ᵐ = aᵐbᵐ
```

### Powers and fractions
See [Fractional indices](#fractionalindices) for fractional indices.
```
(a/b)ᵐ = aᵐ/bᵐ
```

### Zero index
```
a⁰ = 1
where a != 0
```
### Negative indices
```
a⁻ᵐ = 1/aᵐ
```

### Fractional indices
```
a¹/ᵐ = ᵐ√a
aˣ/ᵐ = ᵐ√aˣ
```

## Surds 

Surds are irrational numbers written with a radical sign. They cannot be expressed as a fraction.

For example, `5√6` is a surd. It means `5 x √6`.
```
  _
5√6
```

## Surds

### Addition and subtraction
You can only add or subtract surds if they are like surds. For example, 5√6, 3√6 and √6 are like surds. If you were to add or subtract these together:
```
5√6 + 3√6 + √6 = 9√6
5√6 - 3√6 - √6 = 5√6
```

### Multiplication and division

```
a√b x c√d = ab√cd

√a     / a \
–– = √| ––– |
√b     \ b /
```

What a beautiful attempt at making a big bracket. I'm not bothered to go to the bracket making website right now so you're going to have to deal with it.

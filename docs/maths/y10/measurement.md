# In a Nutshell: Surface Area, Volume and Measurement Formulae
## part of the In a Nutshell series on Adrian's Study Club

### Upper/Lower limits

```nimrod
Lower limit = measurement - 1/2 x smallest unit of measurement
Upper limit = measurement + 1/2 x smallest unit of measurement
```

### Cones

```nimrod
Surface Area = 𝜋r^2 + 𝜋rl   # where l is the slant height
Volume = 1/3 𝜋r^2h          # for oblique cones, the formula is the same, where h is the perpendicular height
```

### Spheres

```
Surface Area = 4𝜋r^2
Volume = 4/3 𝜋r^3
```

### Square pyramid

```
Volume = 1/3 lbh
```

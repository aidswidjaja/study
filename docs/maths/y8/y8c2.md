# Year 8 Maths Chapter 2 - Equations 2 
<label class="label label-green">Complete</label>

*You will want to refer to [Year 7 Maths Chapter 9](../y7/y7c9.html) for basic equations skills. This section is more advanced, and omits algebraic language, basic operations, distributive law, and other basic concepts. It is also suggested you read about [Algebraic techniques](../y8/y8c2.html). For more advanced stuff, you should refer to [Year 9 Maths Chapter 2](../y9/y9c2.html). This section is more basic and omits simulataneous equations*

## Linear equations are when the power of the pronumeral is 1 and there is only one solution. Another type of equation is the simple quadratic equation, which can be expressed as such:

```
x^2 = c
```
The power of the pronumeral is 2. Depending on the value of c, x can have zero to many solutions. 

`x^2 = c` is a simple quadratic equation. If `c > 0`, then your solutions are as follows:

- x = √c
- X= -√c

If `c = 0` there is one solution, which is `x = 0`.

However, if `c < 0` then there aren’t any solutions because x^2 is always positive.

An inequality is a statement of the form:

- LHS > RHS - greater than - `7 > 2`
- LHS ≥ RHS - greater than or equal to - `7 ≥ 7, 7 ≥ 2`
- LHS < RHS - less than - `2 < 7`
- LHS ≤ RHS - less than or equal to - `2 ≤ 2, 2 ≤ 7`

Inequalities can be reversed, for example, `x < 3` and `3 > x` is equivalent. They can also be represented on a number line, as follows.

As you can see, the number line is on the x axis, with an arrow above the corresponding numbers. For example, in the first example, you can see that x is larger or equal to than five. As it is inclusive of five, there is a filled circle. On the contrary, with a statement that lacks the ‘or equal to’ statement, it is exclusive, like in the second example, where 6 is excluded, thus the open circle.

*Tl;dr:* If the statement contains an ‘or equal to’ statement within the inequality, then the circle is open. Otherwise, it is closed.

A range can be represented as a segment on the number line.

Solving inequalities can be performed by finding an equivalent inequality to the given. 

- Adding or subtracting an expression from both sides
- Multiplying or dividing both sides by any positive number
- Multiplying or dividing both sides by a negative number AND reversing the inequality symbol
- Swapping LHS and RHS and reversing the inequality symbol

The above represent methods in which an equivalent inequality can be obtained.

You can use equations to answer a question such as the following:

	Kingston prepares a rabbit for sacrifice in 8 hours. Oscar does that in 6 hours.
	If Kingston and Oscar worked together, how long would it take to sacrifice a rabbit?

Answer:

	Kingston prepares ⅛ of a rabbit in 1 hour.
	Oscar prepares ⅙ of a rabbit in 1 hour.

	∴ together, they prepare ⅛ + ⅙ of a rabbit in 1 hour.
	⅛ + ⅙ = 3/24 + 4/24
	           = 7/24  of a rabbit in 1 hour

Therefore:

	One sacrificed rabbit = 24/7 

~~Unfortunately there doesn’t seem to be one easy way to explain why we flip the fraction.~~ You idiot its because you have to divide it by 7 hours to get 1 hour worth of rabbits

Or!

	Kingston prepares 3 rabbits in 24 hours
	Oscar prepares 4 rabbits in 24 hours

	∴ together, they prepare (3 + 4) rabbits in 24 hours.
	3 + 4 = 7
	         = 7 rabbits in 24 hours

Therefore:

	One sacrifice rabbit = 24/7

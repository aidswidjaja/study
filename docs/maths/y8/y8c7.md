# Year 8 Maths Chapter 7 - Linear Relationships 1

<label class="label label-green">Complete</label>

*You will want to refer to [Year 9 Maths Chapter 4](y9c4.html) for more advanced knowledge of linear relationships. This section is more advanced. For quadratics take a look at [Year 9 Maths Chapter 8](y9c8.html) and [Year 9 Maths Chapter 10](y9c10.html)*

Basic terms and information:

- A **number plane** (or Cartesian plane) includes a y-axis and an x-axis, intersecting at right angles, forming four quadrants.
- Anti-clockwise from top-right: Quadrant 1 - Quadrant 4.
- Point on a number plane has **coordinates**: `(x, y)`, where x is number of horizontal units from origin (x-coordinate) and vice versa (vertical units, y-coordinate).
- The point `(0, 0)` is known as the **origin**.
- A **rule** or a **formula** is an equation connecting two or more variables.
- A straight line forms a **linear** rule.
- Linear rules are often written with y as the subject. For example, `y = 3x - 2`

You can use a **table of values** to find a rule. The rule must be true for every pair of coordinates, substituted into a table or graph.

For example:

	y = ☐x + ☐

To find a rule, use the formula below.

	y = mx + b

where m is the gradient and b is the y-intercept. This is known as **gradient-intercept form**.

- The **gradient** is rise over run. 
- On a graph, it is the steepness of a line, measured by a specific height measurement, over a specific length measurement. 
- For example, for a gradient to be 2, on a graph the line would be increasing in height, and for every 5 units on the x axis, there would be a growth of 10 units. 
- In a table of values, it is the difference in the y-axis between every consecutive number on the x-axis
- The **y-intercept** is the constant value when `x = 0`. 
- The **x-intercept** is the constant value where `y = 0`.

A linear equation has a solution, where a pair of values, representing x-coordinates and y-coordinates, solve an equation when substituted into their relative pronumerals.

Where there are two straight lines crossing over, there is a point of intersection (the point where the lines cross). In this case, the point of intersection is the pair of values that satisfies both rules.

Non-linear relationships are graphs or rules that are not linear (form a curve, such as a parabola).

An example of a non-linear curve:

	y = x^2

You can choose from two mirrors. Google Drive and Netlify CDN. Both are fast options, but they both have different content.

Some content from T1, T2, and T3 are on Google Drive. This doesn't get actively maintained.

If you're studying for finals, they are being actively uploaded to this website (Netlify CDN). 

In the future, we will try and match the two databases so they both have the same content, or limit it only to one.

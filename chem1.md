## Model of an atom

Model of an atom:

1. Small and dense nucleus made up of:
    2. neutrons (uncharged particles)
    2. protons (positively charged particles)
1. Surrounded by rapidly moving electrons
1. Held together through nuclear forces

*Particles with the same charge **repel each other**.*
*Particles with opposite charges **are attracted to each other**.*

Most volume of the electron is made up of empty space.

* Electrons == 1/2000th size of protons and neutrons.
* Electrons have electrical charge of -1
* Protons have electrical charge of +1
* Neutrons have no electrical charge
* Atoms usually have the same number of electrons as neutrons
* Electrons move rapidly around the nucleus, in regions known as [electron shells](#electron-shells)

* In the nucleus: protons and neutrons
* Surrounding the nucleus: electrons

**The number of protons in an atom determines what type of atom it is**

e.g gold atom has 79 protons

## Electron shells
### and the 2, 8, 18 rule
{: .no_toc }

Electrons fill electron shells. The number of electrons a shell can fit increases as the shell's distance from the nucleus increases.

The numnber of electrons a shell can hold is equal to `2n^2` where n is the shell number.

Therefore:
```
2 × 1^2 = 2 (for shell one)
2 × 2^2 = 8 (for shell two)
2 × 3^2 = 18 (for shell three)
```
and so on. This is called the **2, 8, 18 rule**. Electrons fill from the inner most shell going outwards. You can see a diagramatic representation on this electron dot diagram.

#### Examples of electron configurations

Aluminium has 13 protons, therefore aluminium's **electron configuration** is `2, 8, 3`

Sodium has 11 protons, therefore sodium's **electron configuration** is `2, 8, 1`

Oxygen has 8 protons, therefore sodium's **electron configuration** is `2, 6`

## Atomic numbers and mass number

#### Atomic number

We know that the number of protons an atom has dictates what atom it is. In the periodic table, this is known as the atomic number.

```
Number of protons == Number of electrons == Atomic number
e.g Chlorine has 17 protons therefore it's atomic number is 17
```

Atoms are electrically neutral and must have **the same number of electrons as protons**. Otherwise, they become ions.

#### Mass number

```
Mass number == number of protons + number of neutrons
```

Electrons are too small to be counted.

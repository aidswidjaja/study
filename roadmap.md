# Roadmap
## for Things You Should Know and Adrian's Study Club

A majority of the project will be moving everything from Google Docs to Markdown format to host on this site. However, with finals approaching close and our lack of neccessity for Roman numerals migration to the new platform will be done from most recent to least recent. Exceptions may apply for important content. This also means that topic areas from previous years that don't get covered now won't be prioritised as much.

**If you'd like to contribute and help out, please [email me!](mailto:adrian.marcus.widjaja@gmail.com?I want to contribute to Adrian's Study Club!). If your school works from a different curriculum let me know too and we can make an arrangement to mutually benefit both schools!**

Be advised this roadmap also contains information for Things You Should Know and Adrian's Study Club on Quizlet, marked with **[TYSK]** and **[QUIZLET]** respectively. You can also view a roadmap/table of contents on each subject's parent page.

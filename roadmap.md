# Roadmap
## for Things You Should Know and Adrian's Study Club

A majority of the project will be moving everything from Google Docs to Markdown format to host on this site. However, with finals approaching close and our lack of neccessity for learning about Roman numerals, migration to the new platform will be done from topics of most importance to topics of least importance. This also means that topic areas from previous years that don't get covered now won't be prioritised as much.

The roadmap allows us to keep track of what needs to be completed, what has already been completed and what is most important for completion. You can view each subject's roadmap on it's parent page. For example, for the Maths roadmap, you would click on the Maths parent page.

**If you'd like to contribute and help out, please [email me!](mailto:adrian.marcus.widjaja@gmail.com?I want to contribute to Adrian's Study Club!) If your school works from a different curriculum let me know too and we can make an arrangement to mutually benefit both schools!**

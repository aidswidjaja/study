**How is an Award Achieved?**

To earn an Award, each young person must learn a skill, improve their physical well being, volunteer in their community and experience a team adventure in a new environment. All Participants are supported by a network of adult Award Leaders, Assessors, Supervisors, and mentors.
The key elements of our program are:
- Boys can start the Bronze Award at 14 years of age.
- Boys will progress through the Three levels: Bronze, Silver, and Gold, each progressively more challenging. [You can read about the framework here.](http://www.dukeofed.com.au/about-the-award/award-framework/)

**Four Sections: Physical Recreation, Skill, Service, Adventurous Journey plus Residential Project (Gold Level only).**

**Achieving an Award recognises individual goal setting and self-improvement through persistence and achievement.**

Time requirements:
- Bronze – minimum 6 months
- Silver – minimum 6 months if completed Bronze otherwise 12 months for direct entrants
- Gold – minimum 12 months if completed Silver

**What impact does the Award have on a young person?**

Through this challenging journey of self-discovery, our Participants:
- Are equipped and empowered to achieve their personal best;
- Learn to take responsibility for their goals and choices;
- Become connected to and actively engaged within their immediate community;
- Make a real difference to society through their positive contributions and involvement;
- Learn to persevere and overcome barriers to success;

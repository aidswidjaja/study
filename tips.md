## Adrian's Study Tip of the Day

Don't cram everything in just before exam period. It's a good idea to continually revise old content, and if you're on top of that, start new content ahead of the class.

Adrian learnt the hard way in Year 9. And Year 8. And Year 7. Don't be like Adrian.

Also, when answering questions, especially in Humanities subject such as English, History, and Geography, always refer to the [NESA Directive Terms](nesa.html).
